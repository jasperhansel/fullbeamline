! NOTE: notation: p*Q_x + q*Q_y + r*Q_s = n <==> (p, q, r, n)

! NOTE: a line will only be plotted if it meets all the constraints
        simultaneously (restrictions ANDed together)

! NOTE: min tune, max tune, and Q_s are in kHz if axes toggle is 1 and
        normal units (1.0 = 390 kHz) if axes toggle is 0

! NOTE: if ymin = ymax = 0.0 then the program will set ymin = xmin
        and ymax = xmax
  
! NOTE: The PLOT_ALL_1ST_AND_2ND toggle modifies the P RESTRICTION, Q RESTRICTION,
        and SUM/DIFF toggles so that these toggles are only used for lines with
        order (= |p| + |q|) larger than 3. That is to say the PLOT_ALL_1ST_AND_2ND 
        toggle will force the plotting of all 1st and 2nd order lines.

! NOTE: Restricting plotting to q even will mask all lines 
        due to skew multipoles. For example the lines due to skew sextupoles
        are of the form (0, 3, r, n) or (2, 1, r, n).
