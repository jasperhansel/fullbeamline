# In tracking, SAD puts an "fshift" to shift a particle's z-position through every element. 
#   This is done so that the closed orbit will have pz approximately zero.

#   of the solenoid but the on-energy particle orbit is displaced due to the crossing angle.] 
#   Bmad patch elements can be inserted just before RF cavities to mimic this.

# If there is an "fshift" defined in the sad lattice, the value of this needs to be modified
# to take into account small variations in tracking between Bmad/PTC and SAD. In this case, the
