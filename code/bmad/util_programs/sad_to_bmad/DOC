SAD to Bmad Translation

[Note: For Bmad to SAD translation, use the bmad_to_mad_sad_and_xsif program.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------

How to translate: 

The translation script is:
  util_programs/sad_to_bmad/sad_to_bmad.py

There is an example parameter input file at:
  util_programs/sad_to_bmad/sad_to_bmad.params

--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

*) Bmad has no equivalent attribute for a SOL F1 attribute. This is not a problem since
the SOL F1 attribute is only used by SAD for emittance calculations and does not effect
particle tracking. However, it is convenient to preserve this information in the Bmad
lattice so that if the Bmad lattice is back translated to SAD then the SOL F1 information
can be restored. To do this, a custom F1 attribute is defined in the Bmad lattice file.

Known Translation Limitations (at the present time):

CAVI: 
  Parameters not translated: 
    V1, V20, V11, V02
    DISFRIN, FRINGE
    DPHI

Misalignments in SOL element with GEO = 1 not yet implemented.

FB1 and FB2 (MULT and BEND elements) must be equal.

A given MARK element with a non-zero offset cannot appear multiple times in a lattice.
This is due to the fact that the corresponding Bmad element uses superposition.

Conversion cannot handle the same MULT element appearing two different
places in the lattice when the solenoid field is different in these
different places.

MULT elements cannot have a finite bending angle nor can a MULT element have
an RF field.

Important note:
At the exit end of a solenoid, SAD will calculate the reference orbit using particle tracking.
If SAD then generates a lattice, the final SOL element will have the orientation offset parameters 
for the reference orbit.
The translation script is not able to do the reference orbit translation so it assumes that the
shift in reference orbit is given by the orientation offset parameters in the final SOL element.
THUS: It is important to make sure that the orientation offset parameters are in the lattice and,
if not, run the lattice through SAD to generate a lattice with them.

'end' is a reserved bmad element name. If used in the lattice file, 'end_ele' will be substituted.

What to do if translation fails:

Multiple "use" statements may confuse the translator. Remove unused use statements in case of trouble.

"Action" commands, that is, commands that modify the lattice (EG optimizing lattice parameters) cannot
be translated. In fact, these statements may confuse the translator. Remove action commands in case 
of trouble.

If all else fails, or if you want to generate a lattice that has been modified by SAD (EG SAD has
been used to optimize lattice parameters), you can use SAD to generate a lattice file that is
easily converted. Add this to your SAD lattice file:

fout=OpenWrite["new.sad"];
FFS["OUTPUT "//fout//" TYPE"];
WriteBeamLine[fout,Format->"MAIN",Name->{"XXX"}];
Write[fout," FSHIFT = "//FSHIFT//";"];
Write[fout," MOMENTUM = "//MOMENTUM//";"];
Write[fout," USE XXX;"];
Close[fout];

Here "XXX" should be replaced by the name of the line to use.
The one disadvanteage in doing this is that all parameters are evaluated 
and so varialbes used in the original file are lost.
