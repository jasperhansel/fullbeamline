The Optimizer
=============

SPEA2 in an elitist multiobjective evolutionary algorithm which
incorporates a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density
estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. SPEA2
is an improved version of the Strength Pareto EA and described in:

In the k-th nearest neighbor density estimator is generalized to arbitrary k
in comparison with the initial PISA implementation. Its value is supplied
in 'spea2_param.txt' file with 'SQRT' switch instructing to set k = sqrt(M),
where M is the population size. Furthermore, inequality constraints (g(x) >= 0)
are handled through constrain-dominance concept.

The truncation method is implemented efficiently which leads to an
average time complexity of O(M^2), contrarily to the remark in the
footnote 2 on page 8 of the TechReport ZLT2001a. This is achieved by a
lazy evaluation of the k-th nearest neighbors. Normally, the
individuals' k-th nearest neighbors are already different for very low
k values, thus the more distant neighbors are only calculated when
they are actually used and not in advance. Hence, an a priori
computation, sorting and update of the nearest neighbor lists is
avoided.



The Parameters
==============

SPEA2 uses the following values for the common parameters.
These parameters are specified in 'APISA_cfg'.

initial_population_size (size of the initial population)
parent_set_size         (number of parent individuals)
offspring_set_size      (number of offspring individuals, has to be equal to mu)
objectives              (number of objectives)
constraints             (number of constraints)

'APISA_cfg' is a PISA_configuration file.

SPEA2 takes three local parameter which is given in a parameter
file. The name of this parameter file is passed to SPEA2 as command
line argument. (See 'spea2_param.txt' for an example.)

seed         (seed for the random number generator)
tournament   (tournament size for mating selection)
k_neighbor   (k-th neighbor; if 'SQRT' sets k = sqrt(M) population size)
verbose      (YES/NO; reports the size of the first nondominated front)

Source Files
============

The source code for SPEA2 is divided into four files:

'spea2.hpp' is the header file.

'spea2.cpp' contains the main function and implements the control flow.

'spea2_io.cpp' implements the file i/o functions.

'spea2_functions.cpp' implements all other functions including the
selection.

Additionally a Makefile, a APISA_cfg file with common parameters and a
spea2_param.txt file with local parameters are contained in the tar file.

Depending on whether you compile on Windows or on Unix (any OS having
<unistd.h>) uncomment the according '#define' in the 'spea2.h' file.



Usage
=====

Start SPEA2 with the following arguments:

spea2 paramfile filenamebase poll

paramfile: specifies the name of the file containing the local
parameters (e.g. spea2_param.txt)

filenamebase: specifies the name (and optionally the directory) of the
communication files. The filenames of the communication files and the
configuration file are built by appending 'sta', 'var', 'sel','ini',
'arc' and 'cfg' to the filenamebase. This gives the following names for
the 'APISA_' filenamebase:

APISA_cfg - configuration file
APISA_ini - initial population
APISA_sel - individuals selected for variation
APISA_var - variated individuals (offspring)
APISA_arc - individuals in the archive


Caution: the filenamebase must be consistent with the name of
the configuration file and the filenamebase specified for the SPEA2
module.

poll: gives the value for the polling time in seconds (e.g. 0.5). This
      polling time must be larger than 0.01 seconds.



Limitations
===========

None limitations are known so far.



Stopping and Resetting
======================

The behaviour in state 5 and 9 is not determined by the interface but
by each variator module specifically. SPEA2 behaves as follows:

state 5 (= variator terminated): set state to 6 (terminate as well).
state 9 (= variator resetted): set state to 10 (reset as well).
