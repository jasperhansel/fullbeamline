\section*{Introduction}
\pdfbookmark[1]{Introduction}{Intro}

As a consequence of \bmad being a software library, this manual serves two masters: The
programmer who wants to develop applications and needs to know about the inner workings of
\bmad, and the user who simply needs to know about the \bmad standard input format and
about the physics behind the various calculations that \bmad performs.

\index{MAD|hyperbf}
To this end, this manual is divided into three parts. The first two
parts are for both the user and programmer while the third part is
meant just for programmers. 
  \begin{description}
  \item[Part~I] \Newline
Part~I discusses the \bmad lattice input standard. The \bmad lattice input standard was
developed using the \mad\cite{b:maduser,b:madphysics}. lattice input standard as a
starting point but, as \bmad evolved, \bmad's syntax has evolved with it.
  \item[Part~II] \Newline
part~II gives the conventions used by \bmad --- coordinate systems, magnetic field
expansions, etc. --- along with some of the physics behind the calculations. By necessity,
the physics documentation is brief and the reader is assumed to be familiar with high
energy accelerator physics formalism.
  \item[Part~III] \Newline
Part~III gives the nitty--gritty details of the \bmad
subroutines and the structures upon which they are based.

More information, including the most up--to--date version of this manual, can be found at
the \bmad web site\cite{b:bmad.web}.  Errors and omissions are a fact of life for any
reference work and comments from you, dear reader, are therefore most welcome. Please send
any missives (or chocolates, or any other kind of sustenance) to:

The \bmad manual is organized as reference guide and so does not do a good job of instructing the
beginner as to how to use \bmad. For that there is an introduction and tutorial on \bmad and \tao
(\sref{s:tao.intro}) concepts that can be downloaded from the \bmad web page. Go to either the \bmad or
\tao manual pages and there will be a link for the tutorial.

It is my pleasure to express appreciation to people who have contributed to this effort:
To David Rubin for his support all these years, to \'Etienne Forest (aka Patrice
Nishikawa) for use of his remarkable PTC/FPP library (not to mention his patience in
explaining everything to me), to Mark Palmer, Matt Rendina, and Attilio De~Falco for all
their work maintaining the build system and for porting \bmad to different platforms, to
Frank Schmidt and CERN for permission to use the \mad tracking code. to Hans Grote and
CERN for granting permission to adapt two figures from the \mad manual for use in this
one, to Martin Berz for his DA package, and to Dan Abell, Ivan Bazarov, Moritz Beckmann,
Joel Brock, Sarah Buchan, Avishek Chatterjee, Jing Yee Chee, Joseph Choi, Robert Cope, Jim
Crittenden, Gerry Dugan, Christie Chiu, Michael Ehrlichman, Ken Finkelstein, Mike Forster,
Thomas Gl{\"a}{\ss}le Richard Helms, Georg Hoffstaetter, Chris Mayes, Karthik Narayan,
Katsunobu Oide, Tia Plautz, Matt Randazzo, Michael Saelim, Jim Shanks, Jeff Smith, Jeremy
Urban, Mark Woodley, and Demin Zhou for their help.
