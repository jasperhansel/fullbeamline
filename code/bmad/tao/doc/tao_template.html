Many simulation problems fall into one of three categories: 

<ul>

<li> You want to design a lattice subject to various constraints.

<li> You have some measured data and you want to make a correction. For
example, you want to know what steering strength changes will make an orbit
flat.

<li> You want to simulate what happens to the orbit, beta function,
etc., when you change something in the machine.

</ul>


<p>
Programs that are written to solve these types of problems have common
elements: You have variables you want to vary in your model of your
machine, you have "data" that you want to view, and, in the first two
categories above, you want to match the machine model to the data (in
designing a lattice the constraints correspond to the data).

<p>
Because of this commonality of design, the Tao program was developed so that programming with the
Bmad toolkit was not necessary in order to do lattice analysis and design. Tao is a program that
implements the essential ingredients needed to solve simulation problems. Tao uses configuration
input files that can be tailored to specific machines. Additionally, Tao has been built to be easily
customizable so that extending Tao to solve new and different problems is relatively straight
forward.

<h2>The Wisdom of Tao:</h2> 

[As told to <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html">Geoffrey James</a>]

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and
Time. Therefore Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.</p>

<p>Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out
of time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the
Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>How could it be otherwise?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
Thus spake the master programmer:</p>
<p>After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
A novice asked the master: I have a program that sometime
runs and sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming,
yet I am totally baffled. What is the reason for this?</p>

<p>The master replied: You are confused because you do not
understand Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow
humans. Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have
constructed? Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.</p>

<p>The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is
eternal. Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive
enlightenment.</p>

<p>But how will I know when I have received enlightenment? asked the novice.</p>

<p>Your program will then run correctly, replied the master.</p>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
<p>The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. <br>
The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it.<br> 
The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.</p>

<p>If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.</p>

<p>The highest sounds are hardest to hear. <br>
Going forward is a way to retreat. <br>
Great talent shows itself late in life. <br>
Even a perfect program still has bugs.</p>

A novice asked the Master: Here is a programmer that never
designs, documents or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him
consider him one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is
this?</p>

<p>The Master replies: That programmer has mastered the Tao.
He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when
the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has
gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone
else sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of
his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their
purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.</p>
