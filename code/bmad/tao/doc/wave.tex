\section{General Description}
\label{s:wave.general}

A ``wave analysis'' is method for finding isolated ``kick errors'' in
a machine by analyzing the appropriate data. Types of data that can be
analyzed and the associated error type is shown in
Table~\ref{t:wave0}.  

The analysis works on difference quantities. For example, the
difference between measurement and theory or the difference between
two measurements, etc. Orbit and vertical dispersion measurements are the
exception here since an analysis of, say, just an orbit measurement can
be considered to be the difference between the measurement and a
perfectly flat (zero) orbit.

The formulation of the wave analysis for quadrupolar and skew
quadrupolar errors is presented by Sagan\cite{b:wave}.  Although not
discussed in the paper, the wave analysis for orbit and dispersion
measurements is similar to the beta function analysis that is
presented. 

The wave analysis is similar for all the measurement types. How the
wave analysis works is illustrated in Figure~\ref{f:wave}.
Figure~\ref{f:wave}a shows the difference between \vn{model}
and \vn{design} values for the $a$-mode betatron phase for the Cornell's 
Cesr storage ring. In this example, one quadrupole in the model has 
been varied from it's design value. The horizontal axis is the detector index. 

For the wave analysis, two regions of the machine, labeled $A$ and $B$
in the figure, are chosen (more on this later). For each region in
turn, the data in that region is fit using a functional form that
assumes that there are no kick errors in the regions. 
For phase differences, this functional form is
\Begineq
  \delta phi(s) = D \, \sin(2 \, \phi(s) + phi_0) + C
  \label{xabps}
\Endeq
where $\phi$ is the phase
advance and the quantities $C$, $D$ and $\phi_0$ are varied to give the best
fit.  Once $C$, $D$, and $\phi_0$ are fixed, \Eq{xabps} can be evaluated at
any point. Figure~\ref{f:wave}b shows the orbit of \ref{f:wave}a
with the fit to the $A$ region subtracted off. Similarly,
Figure~\ref{f:wave}c shows the orbit of Figure~\ref{f:wave}a with
the fit to the $B$ region subtracted off. Concentrating on
Figure~\ref{f:wave}b, since there are no kick errors in the $A$
region, the fit is very good and hence the difference between the data
and the fit is nearly zero. Moving to the right from the $A$ region in
Figure~\ref{f:wave}b, this difference is nearly zero up to where the
assumption of no kick errors is violated. That is, at the location of
the quadrupole error  near detector 47. Similarly, since there are no kick errors
in region $B$, the difference between the data and the $B$ region fit
is nearly zero in Figure~\ref{f:wave}c and this remains true moving leftward
from region $B$ up to the quadrupole near detector 47.

By taking the fitted values for $C$, $D$, and $\phi_0$ for the regions $A$
and $B$, the point between the regions where the kick is generated and
the amplitude of the kick can be calculated. This calculation is
similar to that used to find quadrupolar errors from beta
data\ref{f:wave}. The one difference is a factor of 2 that appears
in the beta calculation due to the fact that a freely propagating beta
wave oscillates at $2\phi(s)$. 

The success of the wave analysis in finding a kick error depends upon
whether there are regions of sufficient size on both sides of the kick
that are kick error free. That is, whether the kick error is
``isolated''. The locations of the $A$ and $B$ regions are set by the
user and the general strategy is to try to find, by varying the
location of the regions, locations where the data is well fit within
the regions. The data is well fit if the difference between data and
fit is small compared to the data itself. If there are multiple
isolated kick errors, then each error in turn can be bracketed and
analyzed. If there are multiple errors so close together that they
cannot be resolved, this will throw off the analysis, but it may still
be possible to give bounds for the location where the kicks are at and
an ``effective'' kick amplitude can be calculated.

For circular machines, to be able to analyze kicks near the beginning
or end of the lattice, the wave analysis can be done by ``wrapping''
the data past the end of the lattice for another 1/2 turn. This is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{f:wave}. In the Cesr machine, there are
approximately 100 detectors labeled from 0 to 99.  The detectors from
100 to 150 are just the detectors from 0 to 50 shifted by 100. Thus,
for example, the detector labeled 132 in the figure is actually
detector 32.

\section{Wave Analysis in Tao}
\label{s:wave.tao}

Performing a wave analysis in \tao is a three step process:
\begin{example}
  1) Plot the data to be analyzed.
  2) Use the \vn{wave} command to select the data.
  3) Use the \vn{set wave} command to vary the fit regions.
\end{example}

In general, the accuracy of the wave analysis depends upon the
accuracy with which the beta function and phase advances are known in
the baseline lattice used. \tao uses the \vn{model} lattice for the
baseline. If possible, One strategy to improve the accuracy of the
wave analysis is first use a measurement to calculate what the
quadrupole strengths in the \vn{model} lattice should be. Possible
measurements that can give this information include an orbit response
matrix (ORM) analysis, fits to beta or betatron phase measurements, etc.

%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preparing the Data} 
\label{ss:wave.data}

At present (due to limited manpower to do the
coding), the wave analysis is restricted to data that is stored in a
\vn{d1_data} array (\sref{c:data}). That is, the plotted curve to be
analyzed must have its \vn{data_type} parameter set to
\vn{``data''} (\sref{s:init.data}). The possible data types that
can be analyzed are:
\begin{example}
  orbit.x, orbit.y
  beta.a,  beta.b
  phase.a, phase.b
  eta.x, eta.y
  cbar.11, cbar.12, cbar.21      ! Analysis not possible for cbar.21
  ping_a.amp_x, ping_a.phase_x
  ping_a.sin_y, ping_a.cos_y
  ping_b.amp_y, ping_b.phase_y
  ping_b.sin_x, ping_b.cos_x
\end{example}
The curve to be analyzed must be visible. Any combination of data
components may be used:. "meas", "meas-ref", "model", etc.

If data from a circular machine is being analyzed, the data is wrapped
past the end of the lattice for another 1/2 turn. The translation from
the data index in the wrapped section to the first 1/2 section of the
lattice is determined by the values of \vn{ix_min_data} and
\vn{ix_max_data} of the \vn{d1_data} array under consideration
(\sref{s:init.data}):
\begin{example}
  index_wrap \(\longrightarrow\) index_wrap - (ix_max_data - ix_min_data + 1)
\end{example}
For example, for the Cesr example in the previous section,
\vn{ix_min_data} was 0 and \vn{ix_max_data} was 99 to the translation
was
\begin{example}
  index_wrap \(\longrightarrow\) index_wrap - 100
\end{example}

%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Wave Analysis Commands and Output}
\label{ss:wave.cmd.out}

The \vn{wave} command (\sref{s:wave}) sets which plotted data curve
is used for the wave analysis. The \vn{set wave} command (\sref{s:set}) 
is used for setting the $A$ and $B$ region locations. Finally the 
\vn{show wave} command (\sref{s:show}) prints analysis results. 

Example wave analysis output with \vn{show wave}:
\begin{example}
  ix_a:  35  45
  ix_b:  55  70
  A Region Sigma_Fit/Amp_Fit:     0.018
  B Region Sigma_Fit/Amp_Fit:     0.015
  Sigma_Kick/Kick:    0.013
  Sigma_phi:          0.019
  Chi_C:              0.037 [Figure of Merit]

  Normalized Kick = k * l * beta [dimensionless]
     where k = quadrupole gradient [rad/m^2].
  After Dat#     Norm_K       phi
         46      0.0705    30.431
         49      0.0705    33.573
         53      0.0705    36.715
\end{example}
This output is for analysis of betatron phase data but the output for
other types of data is similar.  The first two lines of the output
show where the $A$ and $B$ regions are. The next two lines show
$\sigma_{a}/A_a$ and $\sigma_{b}/A_b$ where $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$
are given by Eq.~(42) of Sagan\cite{b:wave} and 
\Begineq
  A_a \equiv \sqrt{\xi_a^2 + \eta_a^2}
\Endeq
with a similar equation for $A_b$. $\sigma_{a}/A_a$ and
$\sigma_{b}/A_b$ are thus a measure of how well the data is fit in the
$A$ and $B$ regions with a value of zero being a perfect fit and a
value of one indicating a poor fit. Notice that a poor fit of one of
the regions may simply be a reflection that the wave amplitude being
there. The next three lines of the output are $\sigma_{\delta
k}/\delta k$, $\sigma_\phi$, and $\xi_C$, and are given by Eq.~(39),
(43), and (44) respectively of \cite{b:wave}. The last three lines of
the analysis tell where the wave analysis predicts the kicks are and
what the normalized kick amplitudes are. Thus the first of these three
lines indicates that the kick may be somewhere after the location of
datum \#46 (but before the location of datum \#47), The normalized
quadrupole kick amplitude is 0.0705, and the betatron phase at the
putative kick is 30.431 radians.
