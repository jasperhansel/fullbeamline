\chapter{Single Mode}\index{single mode}
\label{c:single}

\index{single mode}
\tao has two \vn{modes} for entering commands. In \vn{Single Mode},
described in this chapter, each keystroke represents a command.  That
is, the user does not have to press the carriage control key to signal
the end of a command (there are a few exceptions which are noted
below). Conversely, in \vn{Line Mode}, which is described in
Chapter~\sref{c:command}, \tao waits until the \vn{return} key is
depressed to execute a command. That is, in Line Mode a command
consists of a single line of input.  Single Mode is useful for quickly
varying parameters to see how they affect a lattice but the number of
commands in Single Mode is limited.

From \vn{line mode} use the \vn{single_mode} command (\sref{s:sing})
to get into \vn{single mode}. To go back to \vn{line mode} type
"\vn{Z}".

\section{Key Bindings}\index{key bindings}
\label{s:key.bind}

\index{key bindings}
The main purpose of Single Mode is to associate certain keyboard keys
with certain variables so that the pressing of these keys will change
their associated model value of the variable. This is called a \vn{key
binding}. Key bindings are established in a startup file by setting
the \vn{var(i)%key_bound} and \vn{var(i)%key_delta} parameters (see
Section~\sref{s:init.var}). After startup, associated variables with
keyboard keys can be done using the \vn{set variable} command
(\sref{s:set}).

The variables are divided into banks of 10. The 0\Th bank uses the
first ten variables that have their \vn{key_bound} attribute
(\sref{s:init.var}) set to True.  the 1\St bank uses the next ten,
etc.  At any one time, only one bank is active. To see the status of
this bank, a \vn{key_table} plot (\sref{s:key.table})can be setup as
shown in Figure~\ref{f:key.table}. The relationship between the keys
and a change in a variable is:
\begin{example}
                 Change by factor of:          
     Variable    -10  -1    1     10
   ----------    ---  ---  ---  -------
    1 + 10*ib     Q    q    1   shift-1   ("!")
    2 + 10*ib     W    w    2   shift-2   ("@")
    3 + 10*ib     E    e    3   shift-3   ("\#")
    4 + 10*ib     R    r    4   shift-4   ("\$")
    5 + 10*ib     T    t    5   shift-5   ("%")
    6 + 10*ib     Y    y    6   shift-6   ("^")
    7 + 10*ib     U    u    7   shift-7   ("\&")
    8 + 10*ib     I    i    8   shift-8   ("*")
    9 + 10*ib     O    o    9   shift-9   ("(")
   10 + 10*ib     P    p    0   shift-0   (")")
\end{example}
In the above table ib is the bank number (0 for the 0\Th bank, etc.),
and the change is in multiples of the \vn{step} (\sref{s:init.var}.
value for a variable. Note: In \vn{line mode}, the command \vn{show
key_bindings} (\sref{s:show}) may be used to show the entire set of
bound keys.

Initially the 0\Th bank is active. The left arrow and right arrow are
used to decrease or increase the bank number.  Additionally the
"\vn{<}" and "$>$" keys can be used to change the deltas for the
variables.

For example, looking at Figure~\ref{f:key.table}, the \vn{"1:"} in the
upper left corner of the \vn{Key Table} shows that the 1\St bank is
active. \vn{key(14)} is associated with the \vn{"4"} key and from the
\vn{Key Table} it is seen that the bound attribute is the
\vn{b1_gradient} of the element named \vn{Q15_2}.  Thus, if the
\vn{"4"} key is depressed in single mode, the value of the
\vn{b1_gradient} of element \vn{Q15_2} will be increased by the given
Delta (0.1000 in this case). Pressing the \vn{"r"} key (which is just
below the \vn{"4"} key) will decrease the value of the
\vn{b1_gradient} by 0.1000. Using the shift key, which is shift-4
(\vn{"\$"}) will increase \vn{b1_gradient} by 10 times the given delta
(1.000 in this case) and \vn{"R"} will decrease, by a factor of 10,
the given delta.

Since element \vn{Q15_2} is also displayed in the \vn{Lattice Layout},
there is a \vn{"4"} drawn above this element that reflects the fact
that the element contains a bound attribute. Since, in this case, the
Lattice Layout only shows part of the lattice, not all key indexes are
present.

\section{List of Key Strokes}\index{single mode!list of Key strokes}
\label{s:keys}

In the following list, certain commands use multiple key strokes. For
example, the \vn{"/v"} command is invoked by first pressing the slash
(\vn{"/"}) key followed by the \vn{"v"} key. \vn{"a $<$left_arrow$>$"}
represents pressing the \vn{"a"} key followed by the left-arrow key.

Additionally, custom commands can be associated with any key using the
\vn{set key} command \sref{s:set}.

\item[c]  
Show constraints.

\item[g]
Go run the default optimizer (\sref{s:tao.opti}). The optimizer will
run until you type a '.' (a period).  Periodically during the
optimization the variable values will be written to files, one for
each universe, whose name is \vn{tao_opt_vars\#.dat}. where \vn{\#} is
the universe number.

\item[v]
Show Bmad variable values in bmad lattice format. See also the
\vn{/v} command. Equivalent to \vn{show vars -bmad} in line mode.

\item[V] 
Same an \vn{v} except only variables currently enabled for optimization are shown.
This is equivalent to \vn{show vars -bmad -good} in line mode.

\item[Z] 
Go back to \vn{line mode}

\item[$<$]
Reduce the deltas (the amount that a variable is changed when you use
the keys 0 through 9) of all the variables by a factor of 2.

\item[$>$]
Increase the deltas (the amount that a variable is changed when you
use the keys 0 through 9) of all the variables by a factor of 2.

\item[$<$left\_arrow$>$]
Shift the active key bank down by 1: ib -$>$ ib - 1

\item[$<$right\_arrow$>$]
Shift the active key bank up by 1: ib -$>$ ib + 1

\item[/$<$up\_arrow$>$]
Increase all key deltas by a factor of 10.

\item[/$<$down\_arrow$>$]
Decrease all key deltas by a factor of 10.

\item[$<$CR$>$]

\item[-p]

determined by \vn{plot%enable}.

\item['$<$command$>$]
Accept a Line Mode (\sref{c:command}) command.

\item[/b]
Switch the default lattice branch (\sref{s:lattice}).

\item[/e $<$Index or Name$>$]
Prints info on a lattice element. If there are two lattices being used
and only the information of an element from one particular lattice is
wanted then prepend with "n@" where n is the lattice index.

\item[/l]
Print a list of the lattice elements with Twiss parameters.

\item[/u $<$Universe Index$>$]
Switch the default universe (\sref{s:universe}).

\item[/v]
Write variable values to the default output file in Bmad lattice format. 
The default output file name is set by \vn{global%var_out}. 
See also the \vn{V} command.

\item[/x $<$min$>$ $<$max$>$]
Set the horizontal scale min and max values for all the plots. This is
the same as setting \vn{plot%x%min} and \vn{plot%x%max} in the \tao
input file. If \vn{min} and \vn{max} are not given then the scale will
be chosen to include the entire lattice.

\item[/y $<$min$>$ $<$max$>$]
Set the y-axis min and max values for all the plots. This is the same
as setting \vn{plot%y%min} and \vn{plot%y%max} in the \tao input
file. If \vn{min} and \vn{max} are not given then an autoscale will be
done.

\item[=v $<$digit$>$ $<$value$>$]
Set variable value. \vn{<digit>} is between 0 and 9 corresponding to a
variable of the current bank. \vn{<value>} is the value to set the
variable to.

\item[=$<$right\_arrow$>$]
Set saved ("value0") values to variable values to saved values. The
saved values (the value0 column in the display) are initially set to
the initial value on startup. There are saved values for both the
manual and automatic variables. Note that reading in a TOAD input file
will reset the saved values. If you want to save the values of the
variables in this case use "/w" to save to a file. Use the
"\vn{/$<$left_arrow$>$}" command to go in the reverse direction.

\item[=$<$left\_arrow$>$]
Paste saved (\vn{value0} column in the display) 
values back to the variable values.  The saved
values are initially set to the
initial value on startup. Use the "\vn{/$<$right_arrow$>$}" command to go in
the reverse direction.
