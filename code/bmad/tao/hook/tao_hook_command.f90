! Subroutine tao_hook_command (cmd_line, found)
!
! Put custom Tao commands here. These commands are searched before the standard
! tao commands are searched. This allows for the defining of new commands and 
! the overwriting of any standard tao command.
!
! This file is already set up so that it is rather simple to add a command. Just
! follow the directions. Keep in mind that you don't have to use the included 
! infrastructure if you feel like doing something really custom -- Just clear
! everything out of here and replace it with whatever you like. All that Tao 
! really cares about is that found is set to either TRUE or FALSE.
!
! Input:
!   cmd_line   -- Character(*): command line
!   found      -- Logical: Set True if the command is handled by this routine.
!                          If false, then the standard commands will be searched
!                          and Tao will spit out an error if the command is not
!                          found
