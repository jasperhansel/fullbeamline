[mmap:create segment failure]

You can try the following:

1. Decrease the symmetric heap area with
   "-x SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE=<value>".
2. Set "--mca sshmem_base_start_address 0" for
   automatic selection by OS of virtual start address for sshmem.

This issue could also be related to CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
kernel option which if enabled prevents access to physical
memory via "mmap". In this case you could try using other
sshmem components instead.

[mmap:file open failure]

You can try the following:

1. Switch to anonymous mapping using "-mca sshmem_mmap_anonymous 0".
   The anonymous mapping is not backed by any file.
2. Set path to backing files explicitly using "-mca sshmem_base_backing_file_dir <path>"

   File: %s
   Error: %s

[mmap:file truncate failure]

File can not be truncated to specified length. 

You can try to switch to anonymous mapping using "-mca sshmem_mmap_anonymous 0".
The anonymous mapping is not backed by any file.

   File: %s
   Size: %llu
   Error: %s
