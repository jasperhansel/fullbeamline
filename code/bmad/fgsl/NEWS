Changes in 1.2.0 (by R Bader):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release introduces support for gsl 2.3. An overview:

1. added support for the multifit_nlinear and multilarge_nlinear interfaces, 
   including example programs
2. added fgsl_rstat_rms, fgsl_rstat_quantile_reset to rstat interface
3. updated the linalg interface with additional Cholesky routines 
   (fgsl_linalg_cholesky_decomp1, fgsl_linalg_cholesky_rcond, 
   fgsl_linalg_cholesky_*2, fgsl_linalg_cholesky_scale*, 
   fgsl_linalg_pcholesky_*, fgsl_linalg_mcholesky_*), with 
   additional QRPT routines, with the linalg_tri triangular matrix routines, 
   with the linalg_cod complete orthogonal decomposition routines
4. added fgsl_permute_matrix and test case
5. updated the randist interface with the multivariate Gaussian distribution
6. updated the multifit_linear interface with fgsl_multifit_linear_rank,  
   fgsl_multifit_linear_gcv* and the fgsl_multifit_*linear_tsvd routines.
7. Travis CI configuration updated by T. Schoonjans
8. added fgsl_spblas_dgem[v,m] to sparse matrix routines
9. minor changes to work around compiler bugs


Changes in 1.1.0 (by Tom Schoonjans):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This branch introduces support for the recently released gsl 2.1. An overview:

1.  fixed compilation of old fgsl 1.0.0 code against gsl 2.1.
    Note that gsl 2.x has some changed APIs compared to 1.x. These changes carry over to fgsl.
2.  removed support for gsl 1.16 and older: users that need to support these older 
    gsl releases need to install fgsl 1.0.0
3.  bindings written for all newly introduced API since gsl 2.0
4.  some changes to existing fgsl API: removed 'size' arguments wherever sensible as 
    these could be obtained from assumed-shape arrays.
5.  general code cleanup: tried to make things more 'Fortran 2003'
6.  several new tests and examples added


Changes in 1.0.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed interface of fgsl_hypot and added that for fgsl_hypot3
  (bug report from Kyle Gerheiser)


Changes in 1.0.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added new calls from GSL 1.16
* fixed bug in poly.f90 test (work space too small, triggered
  for gfortran > 4.5 if -O0 used for build); thanks to Tobias 
  Burnus for pointing this out
* converted to autotools/autoconf based system. 


Changes in 0.9.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added new calls from GSL 1.15, except gsl_pow_uint
  (unsigned unsupported in C interop) and the gsl_vector_equal
  and gsl_matrix_equal calls.
* corrected PUBLICness for some fft calls. Thanks to 
  Dave Allured for reporting this.
* corrected bug in fgsl_odeiv_control_name
* removed unnecessary auxiliary interp functions
* documentation migrated from texi to doxygen-generated HTML.
* Note: I've received files for doing autoconf builds, but
  these have not been integrated yet.

Changes in 0.9.3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added new calls from GSL 1.14
* corrected accessibility of some sorting routines
* added sort routines based on the fgsl_vector type.

Changes in 0.9.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* fixed bug in multimin test. Thanks to Tobias Burnus for 
  pointing this out.
* fix for install target. Thanks to Kay Diederichs for
  pointing this out.
* added new calls from GSL 1.13, except for the VEGAS Monte
  Carlo accessors for which there already was something in
  place which does the job.

Changes in 0.9.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added examples for new APIs
* fixed bug in fft API mapping (assumed shape dummies are
  not interoperable) as well as a mistyped declaration
  (half-caught by NAG 5.2)
* introduced separate kind for complex handling
* constants changed for consistency with GSL 1.12
* added new features from GSL 1.11 and 1.12
* added --debug flag to configure

Changes in 0.9:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added examples for error handling
* added support for double precision complex vectors and matrices
* added linear algebra and eigensystem APIs
* added fourier transform API
* Note: testing of added APIs is not yet complete
* moved testing stuff to tests subdirectory

Changes in 0.8.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* bug fixes
* improved 32 vs. 64 bit handling (--bits switch for configure)
* OS X on Intel support

Fixes and new features in 0.8:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* added string constants describing version and GSL base
* added new features from GSL 1.9 and 1.10 as far as deemed
  necessary for FGSL coverage.

Fixes and new features in first beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* augmented error treatment
* additional compilers added to configure script
* more fgsl_sizeof specifics
* extended (but not finished) manual
* testing much extended and many bugs/missing symbols fixed:
  - special functions
  - permutations and combinations
  - integration
  - permutations and combinations
  - sorting
  - random numbers (partially)
  - histograms (partially)

Fixes and new features in second alpha:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* statistics functions not exported, fixed
* changed permutation/combination data access to return
  a fortran pointer to enable referencing original data
* added further examples, nearly all from C are now mirrored
* added fgsl_sizeof generic, often needed for API calls with
  C polymorphic arguments
* the build process has been improved
