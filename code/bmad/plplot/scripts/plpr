#	Usage: plpr file
#
#       Takes the named metafile and converts it to something your
#       printer will understand.  This will be improved later to handle
#	multiple printers and printer settings.  Only intended for use
#	from the plplot/TK driver!  It deletes the named metafile after
#	converting to the proper type so this is not suitable for
#	general use.
