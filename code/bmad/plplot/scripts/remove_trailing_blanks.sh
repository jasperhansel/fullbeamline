# This script potentially can be quite intrusive since it
# unconditionally removes trailing blanks from essentially all text files
# in the source tree.  So after running this script you should use
# "git diff" to make sure you agree with the source file changes generated
# by this script before committing these generated changes.

# Remove trailing blanks on all files in source tree with the following exceptions.
# * Exclude all files in the .git tree (don't want to mess with our repository).
# * Exclude all binary files recognized in .gitattributes.
# * Exclude all files in the debian, rpm, and lib trees (may review lib later).
# * Exclude all *.patch files.
# * Exclude libqhull/src/mem.h (may review this later when epa_build is updated).
# * Exclude COPYING.LIB (since we want to preserve exact LGPL licensing text).
# * Exclude test_tclmatrix.out (since this file is used to compare with a pltcl result
#   that does generate lines with some trailing blanks).
