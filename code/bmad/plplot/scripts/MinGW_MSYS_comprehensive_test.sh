# Make qmake application and therefore Qt4 libraries accessible to
# PLplot build.  Lower in the PATH in this case because this Qt4 bin
# directory contains a library name (libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll) that is
# identical with a MinGW library name and probably taken from an older
# version of MinGW.
# However, comment this out because qt (even the latest version below)
# is unreliable.  qt.driver_info was produced perfectly by
# test-drv-info.exe on wine but there was still an exit(3) that
# occurred in __mingw_CRTStartup according to gdb.  That exit code of
# 3 generates a make error and everything grinds to a halt.  However,
# if you ignore it and continue, then many examples work with
# qt-related devices, but some do not.  It is quite possible the
# problem with 2010.05 (and prior versions) is they were compiled
# according to http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/compiler-notes.html to
# be compatible with MinGW-4.4, but I cannot get that compiler
# to work with cmake, so forget Qt.
