# Find haru pdf header and library.
#

# This module defines the following uncached variables:
#  hpdf_FOUND, if false, do not try to use haru pdf.
#  hpdf_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find hpdf.h.
#  hpdf_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use haru pdf
#  hpdf_LIBRARY_DIRS, the directory where libhpdf (either shared or static)
#  is found.

# Give preference to header found in hpdf subdirectory (which is the
# result of a build and install of upstream libharu), then if not
# found look for the case of no such subdirectory (which is how the
# Debian system version of libharu headers is installed).
