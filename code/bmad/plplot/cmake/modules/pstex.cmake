# Module for configuring the pstex device driver.

# The following variables are set/modified for the pstex device:
# PLD_pstex                  - ON means the pstex device is enabled.
# pstex_SOURCE               - list of source files other than pstex.c

# N.B. this device driver is parasitic on the ps device driver so you cannot
# enable pstex without ps being enabled.
if(PLD_pstex AND NOT PLD_ps)
  message(STATUS
  "WARNING: PLD_ps is OFF so must set PLD_pstex (which depends on PLD_ps) "
  "to OFF."

  set(PLD_pstex OFF CACHE BOOL "Enable pstex device" FORCE)
endif(PLD_pstex AND NOT PLD_ps)

if(PLD_pstex AND ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS)
  # N.B. the pstex.c code is parasitic on the ps.c code so must be combined
  # with the latter in the plug-in for the ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS case.
