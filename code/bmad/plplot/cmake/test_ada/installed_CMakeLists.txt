# Top-level CMakeLists.txt for the installed version of a simple project consisting of an
# installed "Hello, world" library and an executable to be built to test CMake language support
# for Ada.

# MAINTENANCE
# Use same minimum version for all platforms as the non-Linux platform minimum adopted for
# the PLplot project.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3.2 FATAL_ERROR)

# Before the project command must specify the location where
# the test_ada project looks for CMake Ada language support files.
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules)

# Add C to list of languages enabled to work around some issues with
# CMake language support for Ada.  CMake uses compiler introspection
# to determine some system information such as the principal library
# location for the system, and that part of Ada language support is
# not implemented.  Also, I have discovered one other issue (probably
# related to compiler introspection) when C is not enabled which is
# that the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON target property for the Ada
# library disappears if cmake is rerun.
