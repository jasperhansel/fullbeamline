<A NAME="whatsnew"><H3>What's new?</H3></A>
<H4>Version 1.3</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="#cdPolygonSet">Polygon Sets</A>.  Now you can define
  multiple polygons and draw them all with one simple command.  This required
  a small change to <A HREF="#cdPoint">cdPoint</A> but it is backward
  compatable (unless you've been taking some not-portable shortcuts.)</LI>
  <LI><A HREF="#cdMarker">Markers</A>.  Markers allow you to set a point
  in the CGM file.  Depending on what attributes you set, it may appear
  as a point, plus, astrisk, circle, or cross, in any color and size.</LI>
  <LI>Expert Functions.  I added a bunch of new "expert" functions that
  give you more control over creating your CGM's.  These unfortunatly add
  a lot of complexity to your program, so I don't recomment you use them
  unless you have to.</LI>
  <LI>New Font. Several people requested that I add a fixed width font.
  Courier, Courier Bold, Courier Italic, Courier Bold Italic now occupy
  positions 9-12 respectively in the font list.  I also changed the names
  of fonts so they would match mil-std-2301 which should give a better chance
  of the fonts being displayed correctly. (Except, I kept Helvetica with
  italic, not oblique because FIGleaf got confused.)</LI>
  <LI>New example program, cdexpert shows the use of the expert functions.</LI>
  <LI>changed the way many functions operate.  These changes shouldn't have
  any effect on existing programs.</LI>
  <LI>Makefile for OpenVMS provided by David Mathog 
  (mathog@seqaxp.bio.caltech.edu)</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Version 1.2</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>New Text attributes:
  <UL>
    <LI>cdSetTextPath sets the text direction as right, left, up, or down</LI>
    <LI>cdSetTextOrient sets the angle of the text</LI>
  </UL></LI>
  <LI>Multiple pictures in a file.  Now you can put more than one
    picture in a cgm file, see cdCgmNewPic for details.</LI>
  <LI>Internal changes like using short int's in some places so it may
    take less space in memory when using 16 or 64 bit compilers.</LI>
  <LI>New example programs.
    <UL>
      <LI>cdtext to show the new text attributes.</LI>
      <LI>cdmulti to show the multiple picture capability.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
</UL>

<H4>Version 1.1</H4>
<P>Thanks to Wolfgang Glunz (Wolfgang.Glunz@mchp.siemens.de) who purified it,
pointed out some bugs and did the Borland makefile.
<UL>
  <LI>Switched from using malloc to calloc most cases, solving an off
      by one error in a function I then eliminated.</LI>
  <LI>Added a Makefile for Borland Turbo C++</LI>
  <LI>Fixed a couple of spelling errors, cleared out some dead code, and
      some other trivial things.</LI>
  <LI>Added a new example program cdsimple which walks you through some
      basics.</LI>
  <LI>Added a new function <EM>cdPolyLine</EM> for when you want lines
      with more than two points</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H4>Version 1.0</H4>
<P>Basically, everything is new, this is the first release.
</P>
<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is cd?</H3></A>
<P>
cd is a graphics library.  It allows your code to quickly draw
images complete with lines, arcs, rectangles, polygons, text,  and multiple 
colors.  most geometric shapes can be filled or have a hatch pattern as well.
The output is a CGM file.  If you are unsure of what CGM is, or if
CGM is appropriate for your project, see the 
<A HREF="http://speckle.ncsl.nist.gov/~lsr/cgm.htm">NIST CGM Homepage</A>.
</P><P>
Every effort has been made to ensure that the generated cgm files
conform to the standard, however, if you do not use the library
properly, you could generate invalid metafiles that no one is able
to read, so be careful.
</P>


<A NAME="required"><H3>What else do I need to use cd?</H3></A>
<P>
To use cd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. Any full-ANSI-standard
C compiler should be adequate, although those with PCs will need to replace
the Makefile with one of their own. <STRONG>The cc compiler released
with SunOS 4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler. Get gcc, which is freely
available. See the Sun-related newsgroups for more information.</STRONG>
</P><P>
You will also want a CGM viewer, if you do not already have
one for your system, since you will need a good way to check the
results of your work.
</P>
<A NAME="get"><H3>How do I get cd?</H3></A>
<P>

You can
<A HREF="ftp://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/cgm/">
fetch cd as a gzip'ed tar file</A>, or you can FTP it directly from
zing.ncsl.nist.gov in the subdirectory cgm.
</P>
<A NAME="build"><H3>How do I build cd?</H3></A>
<P>
<em>Note:</em> if you have a non-Unix system, you will need
to acquire versions of "gunzip" and "tar" suitable for
your system. Both have been ported to PC and Mac
environments. Consult newsgroups relevant to your
particular system.
<PRE>
gunzip cd1.3.tar.gz
tar -xf cd1.3.tar
</PRE>
This will create the directory "cd1.3" beneath the current
directory.
</P><P>
change to this directory and examine the Makefile, which you may need
to change slightly depending on your installation (or more than
slightly for a Windows or Mac environment).
On UNIX systems the command "make all" will create the cd library
and three example programs, <EM>cdsimple</EM>, <EM>cdtest</EM>, 
and <EM>color16</EM>.  If you are using Borland Turbo C++ version 3 
(or later I hope) try to make it using makefile.bor
</P><P>
CGM files are always in Network Byte order,  Big-Endian systems use this
ordering.  I wrote this on a Big-Endian machine, but it seems to work on
Little-Endian's as well.  Cd has been tested on
Solaris 2, SunOs 4, Ultrix, Linux, IRIX, OpenVMS, and DOS (Borland).
If you get it to run on other systems, drop me a note.
</P>

<A NAME="basics"><H3>cd basics: using cd in your program</H3></A>
<P>
cd lets you create CGM images on the fly. To use cd in your
program, include the file cd.h, and link with the libcd.a
library produced by "make libcd.a", under Unix. You will
need to adapt the makefile for your needs if you are using
a non-Unix operating system, but this is very straightforward.
</P><P>
Look at the example programs included in this distribution for
examples of using cd.  The programs are <EM>cdsimple</EM> which is
a heavily commented program that makes a small cgm. <EM>cdtest</EM> which
makes a cgm with every different kind of shape you can use.  It
has lines, circles, arcs, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and text  as
well as examples for setting the attributes for them.  So look
at it closely, it is your friend.  The other example program, 
<EM>color16</EM> allocates 16 colors using cdImageColor16 (these
are the 16 standard Windows colors). Than it draws a rectangle
with each of them.  These programs are created automatically when you
"make all".

  you call the function with the same value for an attribute as it
  already has, it will not be changed (so you don't have to worry about
  bloating your CGM with redundant attribute changes.)
  It calls three functions. <A HREF="#cdSetTextFont">cdSetTextFont</A>

  These are all relative to the charater base vector and up vector.  If you

  <DD>Attribute: Character Orientation; Elem Class 5; Elem ID 16<BR>
  Returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.
  (xbase,ybase) is the run and the rise of the line that the text is
  written along.  For regular text that is rotated, set xup = -ybase
  and yup = xbase.  Setting it to something different will result in
  skewed text (which may be what you want.) Text written from bottom to
  top at a 90 degree angle would have the following parameters:
  xup=-1, yup=0, xbase=0, ybase=1.  Text written from bottom to top at
  a 22.5 degree angle would have the following parameters: xup=-1, 
  yup=2, xbase=2, ybase=1.
  </P><P>
  Skewed text can also be created with this function.  (xup,yup) is
  the "Character Up Vector"  which is the vertical line running from the
  bottom of the character to the top.  The skew angle is computed
  independently of the (xbase,ybase) vector.  If you change the Up vector,
  text will be skewed. (xup,yup) is the run and the rise of the up vector.
  Text written with a 45 degree skew would have the following parameters:
  xup=1, yup=1, xbase=1, ybase=0.  Changing xup to 2, the skew
  angle becomes 22.5 degrees.  You can, of course, have text that
  is both skewed and rotated by inserting the proper parameters.
  </P><P>
  This function adds the Orientation to the metafile every time.
  It does not interpert an attribute value of -1 as no change like many
  functions do.

  <DD>Attribute: Interior Style; Elem Class 5; Elem ID 22<BR>
  Returns 1 for success, 0 for failure.
  Sets the style of the interior of filled area elements.
  <EM>instyle</EM> is the interior style which is an integer with
  possible values of:
  <UL>
    <LI>0 for hollow.  No filling, but the boundary (bounding line) of the 
    filled area is drawn using the fill colour currently selected.  
    The boundary of a "hollow" filled area is considered to be the
    representation of the interior.  The boundary is distinct from the edge,
    and is drawn only for "hollow" filled areas</LI>
    <LI>1 for solid. Fill the interior using the fill colour currently
    selected</LI>
    <LI>3 for hatch.  Fill the interior using the fill colour and hatch index
    currently selected.</LI>
    <LI>4 for empty.  No filling is done and no boundary is drawn, i.e.,
    nothing is done to represent the interior.  The only potentially
    visible component of an "empty" filled area is the edge, subject
    to EDGE VISIBILITY and other edge attributes.</LI>
  </UL>
  <EM>instyle</EM> must be one of these values or the function will fail. 
  So, basically, if you want an interior which is transparent and you can

  <DD>cdMaxColors is the maximum number of colors that can be allocated in
  a CGM picture.  the CGM standard allows for many different ways of
  allocating colors, but I have chosen to limit this library to
  8 bit indexed color.  This means the <EM>maximum</EM> value of this

  than make this number small.  If there is lots of variablility in the
  size of your CGM's, make this number large.  If CDGROWLISTSIZE is
  larger than CDSTARTLISTSIZE, you should probably increase the value

<H3><A NAME="replacegd">Using cd instead of gd</A></H3>
<P>
CD was designed to be easy to use instead of gd (or with gd, if you want
to be able to produce both).  However, There are significate differences
between the way CGM handles attributes versus the way gd does.  In particular,
gd requires you to put the line color in the function call to draw lines,
CD does not, Color, like the other attributes only need to be set when
they are changed.  I recomend that you read over the documentation of both
to see what the differences are, and make appropriate changes to your
code.  If you really want to make as few changes as possible to your
code, I have provided two functions to help you.  <EM>cdImageLine</EM>
takes the same parameters as <EM>gdImageLine</EM> and will draw
a solid line of the color specified.  <EM>cdImageRectangle</EM>
draws a hollow rectangle with solid edges of the color specified.  I
did this by drawing four lines, so it is not a true rectangle.
Again, I recomend you use <EM>cdLine</EM> and <EM>cdRectangle</EM>
instead of these, but they are there if you want them.

<H3><A NAME="informing">Please tell us you're using cd!</A></H3>

When you contact us and let us know you are using cd,
you help us justify the time spent in maintaining and improving
