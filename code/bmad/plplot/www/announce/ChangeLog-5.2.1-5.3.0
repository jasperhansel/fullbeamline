rudimentary documentation of our configuration environment variables.
Also included specific instructions for Cygwin and solaris.

Since on Octave 2.1.53 glob returns a cell array instead of a padded char

[ RL for AWI: ]

The include directories aren't specified quite correctly in
bindings/python/Makefile.am.

AM_CPPFLAGS = $(INCLTDL) -I/$(PYTHON_INC_DIR) -I/$(PYTHON_NUM_DIR) $(X_CFLAGS)

should be replaced by

AM_CPPFLAGS = $(INCLTDL) -I$(PYTHON_INC_DIR) -I$(PYTHON_NUM_DIR) $(X_CFLAGS)

The first way puts a double slash in the result (since both PYTHON_INC_DIR
and PYTHON_NUM_DIR already have a leading slash). This double slash confuses
the Cygwin compiler and shouldn't be there anyway.

-------------------------------------

[ Forcing cvs commit to get the correct log message, screwed up in the
  previous commit: ]

When PLplot is configured with disable_shared, dyndrivers must also be
disabled. However, this test was done too late in configure.ac, after the
libltdl checks were done conditionally on the value of enable_dyndrivers.
This was causing needless checks and configuration of libltdl.

Since this check is done now before AC_PROG_LIBTOOL, where enable_shared is
usually initialized, an explicit initialization of enable_shared (=yes)  was
needed at the beginning of configure.ac.

AWI for Andrew Ross memory management cleanup.

Add #ifndef ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS ... #endif about the lines in
plD_dispatch_init_XXXXX which assign pdt->pl_MenuStr and pdt->pl_DevName. If
this is a dynamic driver then we have already assigned these strings in
plcore.c using the database. We absolutely don't want to use a static string
in the dynamic driver to initialise it with since that string will disappear
once the driver is unloaded and we are left with no valid driver name or
menu item. Oh and overwriting the string will also leak the previously
allocated memory for the names.

Commit from airwin (2004-01-19 19:09 CET)

Documentation of the changes to the WIN32 driver
dd. 16 january 2004, by A. Markus

Note 1:
The files in this tree are expressly in Windows/DOS format
The reason is that we are not sure that UNIX/Linux format
would be acceptable to all compilers.

Note 2:
Since the changes are legion, I have documented them in detail.

win32/msdev/README.TXT
Added my name to the file

win32/msdev/makefile
Small corrections regarding the creation of the tmp directory
and copying all files to it.

win32/msdev/DExamples/DExamples.mak
Default target now x01d (release).
Added the flag __PLDLL_H__ - this must be defined, if the DLL
is to be used (see README file).
Path to the source files and the extension changed.

win32/msdev/plpdll/plpdll.mak
Added the flag "BUILD_DIR" to the compile step.
Relative path to the tmp directory.
plimage.c added to the makefile
Changed the extensions of some source files (from .cpp to .c)

win32/msdev/plplib/plplib.mak
Added the flag "BUILD_DIR" to the compile step.

win32/msdev/src/win3.cpp
Added a function w32_tmpfile() to solve the problem of
opening temporary files on network disk (the main directory
is often read-only and the version of tmpfile() that comes
with Windows, ignores the environment variables but simply
opens in the directory "\").
Replaced the export keyword by __declspec(dllexport)
(this seems to be the recommended way).

win32/msdev/src/plplotd.def
Added the routines plGetCursor, plParseOpts and plMergeOpts.

win32/msdev/src/plplot.rc
Corrected the path to the include files.

win32/msdev/src/plstub.cpp
Added stubs for the routines plGetCursor, plParseOpts and plMergeOpts.
Corrected call to plpoly3()
Corrected stubs for plshade() and plshade1() (prototypes for the
function arguments caused trouble)

win32/msdev/src/plplot.h
Updated the plplot.h file from a previous version.
Added the flag __PLDLL_H__ to select between three situations:
- Compiling the generic sources and Windows applications using the
  static library (neither __PLSTUBS_H__ or __PLDLL_H__ defined):
  Requires that the names c_plinit() and the like be untouched
  Define a macro plinit for user-code on non-Windows systems
- Compiling the Windows stubs (only __PLSTUBS_H__ defined):

Commit from rlaboiss on branch v5_3_0 (2004-01-18 21:33 CET)
-------------------------------------

Add libplplot.la, as well as libcsirocsa.la (conditionally on with_csa) and
libcsironn.la (conditionally on with_qhull) to get_drv_info_LDADD such that
when get-drv-info is run to generate the *.rc files on MacOS X, there will
be a chance that lt_dlopenext will work without needing to set
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

-------------------------------------

Changed the less robust @prefix@/@DATA_DIR@/examples/octave// to ./octave//
in octavedir.  plplot-test.sh works now from everywhere the examples
directory is installed.

This change is done in a relative hush, to make Alan happy and also before I
tag everything v5_3_0_rc1.  Everyday there is a new cool patch to apply...
Sigh...

Please, notice that this is committed only to the v5_3_0 branch.

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-01-17 17:41 CET)
--------------------

This jumbo cvs commit is the result of a herculean task to update the
copyright notices of most of the source files of PLplot.

I hope that I did not introduce any serious breakage.  This seems plausible,
because I did changes only at the beginning of the files and only in
commented lines.  However, I used a semi-automatic procedure for doing that
and some bugs may have slipped into the files.  The sources still build okay
(at least the Debian packages) and I can install the libraries, and compile
and run some C examples.  That is not enough, so PLEASE TEST!

This is what I did in more detail:

1) From the CVS ChangeLog, I considered all the files that changed since the
   last release (5.2.1).  I then added the line:

       Copyright (C) 2004  Joe C. V. S. Committer

   where the name of the developper who did the CVS commit is included.

2) Notice that the year in the line above should read 2004, even if the
   changes were done last year, since Copyright years refer to when the
   software is released.

3) For the same reason, I did not bother adding missing Copyright entries
   for previous authors of each file.  One copyright holder is enough for
   our purposes.

4) I also reformatted and reworded the License Conditions text.  This
   included changing things like "This file is free software" to "PLplot is
   free sofware" and so on.

5) Finally, some files were lacking License notices, especially the src/*.c.
   I added them and put in the Copyright holder line the name of the
   developer who did the last cvs commit for the file.

If you wish to know where your name appears, you can run from the
$(top_builddir):

    grep -ri "copyright.*2004".

Commit from airwin (2004-01-16 18:24 CET)
------------------

Rafael's script-based method of getting and using libtool information to
solve mkoctfile linking issues and a more careful approach to overcoming the
run library path issues of mkoctfile has proved successful not only on Linux
but also cross-platform. Therefore, abandon the pure libtool-based approach
to build the octave interface.

Note, we use the pure libtool-based approach to build every other interface,
and building the octave interface worked fine with the pure libtool approach
in the Linux case, but there was one cross-platform showstopper (couldn't
get the -shrext libtool option to work in the documented manner to set the
shared object suffix to .oct as demanded by octave) that I hadn't solved yet
when Rafael beat me to a solution using a special script-based method.

Start here, if future developers want to use the pure libtool approach for
building the octave interface.

Commit from airwin (2004-01-16 18:18 CET)
------------------

Change script to simply mimic stdin except for case of -framework option
used by MacOS X.  In that case escape options by appropriate -Wl, commands
to pass on the -framework options to the linker via libtool.

Note this change is simply to get the script right for historical purposes
since it will soon be removed to CVS attic.

Set correctly LD_RUN_PATH when generating plplot_octave.oct locally .  The
Octave bindings work now in the build tree without PLplot installed in the
system.

AM_CONDITONALs for with_csa and with_qhull have been defined in sysloc.in
and are used in bindings/octave/Makefile.am for selectively adding path
components to LD_RUN_PATH.

Also, changed one lasting ugly "../.." to "$(top_builddir)" in

Fortran API change as discussed on the list.

All plshade[0-2] and plshade fortran calls now have a last parameter which
is the first dimension of the 2D arrays.  This extra parameter is similar to
what is currently done for the fortran versions of plmesh, plmeshc, plot3d,
plot3dc, plshades[0-2], and plshades.  It allows large static 2D arrays to
be dimensioned in fortran apps which call these PLplot functions (plcon[0-2]
and plcont have similar possibilities for large static arrays done a
different way).  This in turn allows smaller areas of the fortran array to
be populated as needed (interactively from input, say) without having to
recompile for every change in size of the defined part of the array.

These recent Fortran API changes have been tested for fortran examples 15
and 16a (now both changes to use static arrays dimensioned larger than the
defined area), and identical results to the previous are obtained.
Furthermore, memory management has been changed substantially for fortran
plshade[0-2] and plshade, and valgrind applied to fortran examples 15 and
16a show no problems with these memory management changes.

Restructured the pkg-config support.

Everything that was scattered across pkgcfg/gen-pc-files.sh and
pkgcfg/Makefile.am (shell code) as well as pkgcfg/plplot-master-pc.in (.pc
file template) is now regrouped in the single Perl script
gen-pc-files.pl.in, configurable through configure.

Since Perl is needed now, the code in configure.ac was changed, such that
pkg-config support is disabled if Perl cannot found in the system. Also the
pkg-config section in configure.ac was moved after the call to
CHECK_PROG(perl).

The Tcl/Tk specific cflags for include directories are now integrated in
plplot*-tcl.pc.  The file examples/tk/Makefile.examples.in was changed
accordingly.

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-01-06 13:38 CET)
--------------------

Variable substitution for generation of bindings/octave/plplot_octave.h is
now done with help of autoconf/automake.

A new AC_SUBST variable called DEFINE_PL_DOUBLE is defined in configure.ac,
which is set to "#define PL_DOUBLE" if $with_double == yes, or a null string
otherwise.

The old file plplot_octave_org.h has been renamed to plplot_octave.h.in and
its name is included in the AC_CONFIG_FILES list in configure.ac.  It
contains the token @DEFINE_PL_DOUBLE@ at the place of the old REPLACEME
token.

Since everything is set up automatically by Automake, the rule for building
plplot_octave.h is removed from bindings/octave/Makefile.am.  Also, there is
no need to include plplot_octave.h in the CLEANFILES list.

Fix for the "centuries old" very irritating bogus warning messages about
itclDecls.h during configuration (this should improve your day :).

The problem was, itclDecls.h apparently is not meant to be included except
from itcl.h, or after itcl.h has been included first.  So, this dependency
needed to be accounted for, and fortunately there is an autoconf construct
to do it.  As is often the case with these things, very simple once you know
what to do.

    $CONFIG_SITE
    $prefix/share/config.site
    $prefix/etc/config.site

So to reproduce the previous plplot config file behavior, do:
$ CONFIG_SITE=~/config/cf_plplot.in ./configure

The latter is the *only* way currently to set prefix via a config file.  In
this case, set ac_default_prefix appropriately ("pl_prefix" was previously
used for this purpose).  Also some obsolete commentary removed.

Improve portability of libpthread-related code

In sysloc.in, a new AC_DEFINE macro is created: PLPLOT_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.  In
darwin systems it will expand to PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE, otherwise to
PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP.

Also, in xwin.c, pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np() was changed to
pthread_mutexattr_settype(), since this should work in all systems.

Eliminate "p" examples from test because they user higher-level octave
programming that demands octave-2.1.50 or better (which not all users have).

We have kept the remaining "x" examples for this test.  They are worth
having since they directly test the octave interface to libplplot and they
work for octave-2.0.x or later.

Get rid of lots of "default" linking cruft in configure.ac. Instead, use

There is more of this to do for the (i)tcl/tk flags, but that is a more
complicated situation, and in any case tcl/tk configuration needs a complete
rewrite in other ways as well.

--------------------

* Created the AC_SUBSTituted variable PKG_CONFIG_ENV. This variable replaces
  the previous PKG_CONFIG_PATH.  It defaults to the usual
  "PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_DIR", but can be overriden by using the
  environment variable of same name.  This is done in debian/rules for
  instance , since setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not necessary in Debian.  The
  echo from the make command in the installed examples directories is much
  cleaner now (in Debian, at least):

      $ cd examples/c
      $ make -n x01c
      gcc x01c.c -o x01c  `pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd`


* Added $(RPATH) to the compilation command under the pkg-config approach in
  the examples/*/Makefile.examples.in.


* In examples/tk/Makefile.examples.in, added include flags specific to
  Tcl/Tk in the compilation command under the pkg-config approach.  A new
  variable TCLTKINCCMD was created, which is also used in INCLUDEANDLIB.

Add top-level Makefile to installed examples tree.  To do this and to
avoid name clashes with existing Makefiles, the configurable file is
called Makefile.examples.in which is configured to Makefile.examples which
is renamed on install to Makefile.

The resulting Makefile in the installed examples tree is of considerable
usefulness.  Previous instructions were "cd c; make; cd c++; make; cd f77;
make; cd tk; make; cd ..; ./plplot-test.sh".  Those are now simply replace
(in the _installed_ examples tree or a copy of it) by "make;
./plplot-test.sh".  Also, the subdirectories are now configured in the
generated Makefile so the instructions don't have to be modified if, e.g.,
fortran, is not enabled.

* These variables are used to configure bindings/*/pkgIndex.tcl which are
then concatanated into bindings/pkgIndex.tcl.  The latter file is installed
in the $prefix/share tree.  It allows needed PLplot libraries or plug-in
drivers to be found in the $prefix/lib tree directly from the tclsh or wish
environments using the lappend command.

* With these changes (which adjust for moving all the installed PLplot
tcl/tk scripts from the $prefix/lib tree to the $prefix/share tree) I can
once again execute PLplot commands from tclsh and wish environments
following the instructions in examples/README.tcldemos and

Fixed several issues related to the *_DIR variables

* Made the treatment of the *_DIR even more systematic now.  These variables
  are really intended to AC_SUBSTitution in the Makefile.in generated from
  Automake.  As such, they are always relative, never hard paths.

* When it is needed to get them substituted as hard paths (like in config.h
  via AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED, or in the examples/*/Makefile.examples), then new
  variables are defined.  In particular, this is the case of the new
  variables INCLUDE_DIR_CMD and LIB_DIR_CMD, which should be used in
  examples/*/Makefile.examples and fix the problems with the plplot_libtool
  approach.

* In order to help expansion of hard paths, the macro EXPAND_EXPRESSION was
  added to acinclude.m4.

* Support for pkg-config was added to examples/tk/Makefile.examples.in.
  Build of the examples in examples/tk with pkg-config is not working yet,
  though.  The Tcl/Tk include directories are not being included.  I will
  fix this later.

the fortran interface wrappers for plline3, plpoin3, and plpoly3.

Commit from airwin (2004-01-02 22:42 CET)
------------------

* Style changes (comments, indentation, do loops).

* Make this fortran "chart recorder example" work for first time.  There are
some inevitable differences relative to the C version.

  . Used g77 (and solaris fortran and ?) library rand function to generated
    random numbers.  Users will probably have to substitute some other
    library call for random numbers for other compilers.  Note the numbers
    returned by rand are different from those of the C Library routine
    drand48 so the interactive results look different (but still it looks
    like a chart recorder which is cool.)

  . plsError not part of the PLplot common API so bypassed it and let PLplot
    do its own error handling.

  . Dropped sleep interval from loop.  10 ms is about right, but the g77
    sleep routine only has a resolution of 1 second (which is like watching
    paint dry).  Actually eliminating the loop delay altogether still makes
    a good-looking "chart-recorder" example (at least on my 600MHz machine).

Fix for -dev tk on Linux.  src/plctrl.c requires BIN_DIR to be set to the
hard install path in order for -dev tk to find things.  To accomplish this
make the following fix:

-AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(BIN_DIR, "$BIN_DIR",
+AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(BIN_DIR, "`eval eval echo $BIN_DIR`",

This follows what was done for most (not all) other _DIR variables. I could
find no other use of BIN_DIR in the build tree other than above so I think
this is okay.

Nevertheless, it is a tentative fix because I have spot-rezoned what Rafael
has done recently for his massive changes of all the _DIR variables, and he
may have had something else in mind.

Use pkg-config in examples/*/Makefile.examples when appropriate

   - Makefile.examples are now under Automake control.  This means that
     Makefile.examples.in are removed from the CVS repository and replaced
     by Makefile.examples.am.  The Makefile.examples.in are automatically
     generated by bootstrap.sh (no change to the script was needed for
     that).

   - In the Makefile.examples.am, the rule to build the examples look
     like this:

     .c$(EXEEXT):
     if have_pkg_config
             $(CC) $< -o $@ `pkg-config --cflags --libs plplot$(LIB_TAG)`
     else
             plplot_libtool --mode=link $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< $(INCLUDEANDLIB) -o
+$@
     endif

   - The AM_CONDITIONAL have_pkg_config is exercised in configure.ac and
     will be "true" when the pkg-config program is found in the system.
     Also, there is a configure option --without-pkg-config (or
     --with-pkg-config=no) that will disable the use of pkg-config and
     fallback to plplot_libtool.

Change the logic of the previous bug fix so the test for what to do with the

plshade.

Commit from airwin (2004-01-01 01:41 CET)
------------------

Fixed subtle bug for the corner case when pltr == NULL AND contouring is
wanted.  In this case, plshades is supposed to have the same interpretation
as plshade, that is if pltr == NULL then transform the x and y index ranges
to the ranges xmin to xmax, and ymin to ymax.  Normally, that transformation
was accomplished by simply passing on pltr to plshade to deal with using the
correct transformation.  But a complication arose for pltr == NULL when
plshades was asked to also invoke plcont after its invocations of plshade.
The plcont interpretation of pltr is different, and in fact it must be
specified so the NULL was causing a segfault.  The solution for the case of
pltr == NULL and contouring is to generate the appropriate x and y grids
ranging from xmin to xmax and ymin to ymax on the fly and set up the
invocation of plcont from plshades appropriately.

I copied the ideas for the necessary memory management from other plplot code
and tested the result with valgrind to make sure no memory management issues
have been introduced by this bug fix.

    to be AC_DEFINEd and BIN_DIR does not need to be AC_SUBSTituted, so
    removed those calls.

--------------------

Sane treatment of DATA_DIR and DRV_DIR

The variables/#defines DATA_DIR and DRV_DIR are treated now in a more
coherent and Autotools-friendly way.  The main changes regard:

    - Use of $libdir and $datadir as prefixes of DRV_DIR and DATA_DIR,
      respectively, in configure.ac.  This allows users to easily override
      the installation locations when running configure (options --libdir
      and --datadir).  The environment variables DATA_DIR and DRV_DIR are
      still honored.

    - DRV_DIR is an absolute path now, not relative to DATA_DIR as before.
      Besides it being cleaner and more intuitive, the new design allows
      better compliance with the FHS.  Indeed, architecture-independent
      files (like the font amd map files, as weel as examples and the Tcl
      stuff) go by default in $prefix/share, while driver module files
      (which are architecture-dependent) go in $prefix/lib.

As regards final results, the only difference with the previous situation is
that the *.fnt and *.map files are installed now in plplot<version>/ instead
of plplot<version>/data.  I did not try to keep the previous situation
because it would imply in the definition of a new variable/#define.
However, if the other developers have really strong arguments in favor of
it, I will implement that.

-----------------

Drop Octave-2.0.x compatibility at the script level. The PLplot library bindings are still Octave-2.0.x compatible.

Octave-2.0.x is very old, and even the Octave developper recomends using Octave-2.1.50.
The script components of the Octave bindings now require Octave-2.1.50 or greater;
however, the PLplot library bindings are still compatible with any Octave version.

Commit from airwin (2003-12-28 21:25 CET)
------------------

Embedded underscore fix.  For g77 all names by default that originally have
an underscore in them have two underscores appended rather than the usual
one.  hello ==> hello_ while hello_world ==> hello_world__ . Therefore, I
have appended an additional underscore to the three plplot function names
(pl_setcontlabelformat, pl_setcontlabelparam, and plcalc_world) that have an
underscore embedded, and this seems to build and execute fine with g77,
while the build fails on g77 without this fix.  We may have to do something
additional for some platforms/compilers to get them to work with this g77
default naming convention as well, but apparently, the reason this is the
default for g77 is this is the behaviour of many Unix fortran compilers
(according to info g77).

incorrect arguments in some cases, and the 15th example uses more than 3
colours in cmap0 so that is why plscmap0n(3) is commented out in the C
example case and is now dropped altogether in this fortran example case) and
(b) obtain exact agreement with file results from the corresponding C
example. This agreement confirms that the fortran interface plshade0

Changed many instances of AC_MSG_RESULT to more appropriate autoconf macros,

of AC_MSG_CHECKING/AC_MSG_RESULT around some checks where feedback to the
user was lacking (like in the Java checking section).

In implementing the changes, I noticed that there is a repetition of code
(probably done by cut & paste) for checking several different libraries (gd,
png, libz, etc).  I will try to change the code using the very nice
FIND_LIB* and FIND_INC* suites defined in acinclude.m4.

Revert the previous changes regarding includion of the drivers/*.rc files

built with "make" by the user.  The result is that the *.rc and get-drv-info
are built anyway.

I will think later on a better way to include the *.rc files in the tarball.

    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(plplot, 5.2.1)

have been modernized to:

    AC_INIT(plplot, 5.2.1, plplot-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
    AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src/plcore.c)
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

(see "info autoconf" and "info automake" for details).

The three scripts that parsed configure.ac and relied on the old-style call
of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE have been changed accordingly.

Disabled generation of reconfig script by configure

As per our discussion in plplot-devel in September 2003 (and since Maurice
agreed), the section in configure.ac responsible for the generation of the
reconfig script is removed.  The command "./config.status --recheck" has the
same effect (i.e. calling configure with the previously specified options).

In order to keep the functionality for the fingers too used to type
"./reconfig", a one-line shell script called reconfig has been added to the
repository.

Also, added reconfig to the EXTRA_DIST variable in the top-dir Makefile.am,
such that the script gets included into the distribution tarball.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-12-26 15:14 CET)
--------------------

Include most drivers/*.rc files in the distribution tarball

The goal of this change is to avoid the building of the drivers/*.rc files
by the users by including them into the distribution tarball.  This also
avoids the building of the get-drv-info utility when running "make" from the
tarball.

The price paid for this improvement on the user's side is that "make" is
needed before "make dist" (see scripts/make-cvs-tarball.sh). This happens
because get-drv-info needs libplplot, which needs libcsirocsa and libcsironn
in turn.  Also, libltdl needs to be built.

Since this change only affects the tarball construction and since the price
paid is too small compared with the gain obtained, I decided to implement
the new behavior. If anybody objects, please let us discuss in plplot-devel.

In function plOpenFile, the message "Opened <filename>" is sent now through
pldebug.  This means that it will not spuriously appear on stderr anymore,
but will be issued when option -debug is specified.  Also, the message
"Can't open <filename>" is sent now to stderr instead of stdout.

In function plLibOpenPdfstr, two calls to pldebug are fixed now (called with
two argments instead of three).

Debian release 5.2.1.cvs.20031030-2

>From the changelog:

  * debian/rules: Call configure with --enable-static, such that the
    lib*.a files will be present in the *-dev packages (closes: #224550).
  * debian/control: Changed architecture of packages libplplot-dev and
    plplot-tcl-dev from "all" to "any", because of the *.a files included.

Made the Math::Trig module export only the symbol `pi', to avoid conflict
with PDL definitions.  Also, some small formatting cleanups were done.

PDL demos for PLplot.

Added Perl examples directory, which work with the PDL::Graphics::PLplot
module (PDL version 2.4 or later).  For now, only example x01.pl is written.

The files README.perldemos and x01.pl will be unconditionally installed in
the $(DATA_DIR)/../examples/perl directory.  Of course, the scripts only
work if PDL is installed.

Commit from airwin (2003-12-12 04:48 CET)
------------------

Convert all floating-point constants in fortran examples to standard
double-precision form.

e.g., .3 ==> 0.3d0.

Also, convert ugly dble (0.3), etc.  in argument lists to 0.3d0.

This was all done by a fairly well tested sed script that I have developed
for a different project.

Examples 3, 9, 11, and 13 gave slightly different (but still visually
acceptable) answers as a result.

I just noticed that the Octave function octave_config_info accepts an
argument.  This slightly simplifies the OCTAVE_CONFIG_INFO macro.  This
change was tested only with Octave 2.1.50.  Hopefully it will work with any
version of Octave supported by PLplot.

- Make default visual the default, use "-drvopt defvis=0" to not use the
  default visual.
- Add "usepth" driver specific option; enable pthreads by default, use
  "-drvopt usepth=0" to not use pthreads to redisplay the plot.
- Fix subtle bug when using pthreads with two or more plot windows; when
  resizing one of them  the resize/replot was directed to the plot window on
  he current stream.

Mostly cosmetic changes that enable plplot to compiled with (almost) no
warnings, even with gcc -Wall.

Most changes are just casts, and most of them are tcl/tk related. For
tcl/tk-8.4, no warnings occurs. Also tested with tcl/tk-8.3, where some
warnings remain.  There are no java/f77/cxx/python/octave changes.

Debian release plplot-5.2.1.cvs.20031027-3.

>From the debian/changelog file:

  * debian/rules:
    - Added symlinks /usr/lib/lib{nn,csa}.so.0, such that this release of
      the libplplot5 package does not break binary compatiblity with previous
      released versions of PLplot (closes: #217895).  This is an interim
      solution.  Probably, the upstream authors will have to change the
      soversion or revert the changing of names of the libscsiro{nn,csa}
      libraries in order to get the problem cleanly fixed.
    - Call configure with --disable-java, since enable_java has been made
      the default in the upstream configure.ac.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-10-29 14:38 CET)
--------------------

libnn -> libcsironn and libcsa -> libcsirocsa have broke backward binary
compatibility for the PLplot library.

--------------------

Debian release 5.2.1.cvs.20031027-1.

>From the debian/changelog file:

  * New CVS snapshot upstream release.  This release is actually quite
    close to the latest Debian 5.2.1-21, since I have been tracking CVS
    developments since the upstream release 5.2.1.  One of biggest
    advantages of this move is the enourmous reduction in the size of the
    diff.gz file:

      du -b plplot*diff*
      2686036 ../plplot_5.2.1-21.diff.gz
      10198   ../plplot_5.2.1.cvs.20031027-1.diff.gz

    This huge difference is due to the patched documentation file and the
    necessity of an uuencoded file for the Debian packages.

  * debian/rules: Removed all manipulations (targets "build" and
    "clean") related to the plplot-5.2.1-new-doc.tar.gz.uu file, which is
    not included in the source package anymore.  Also, added flag -k to
    make distclean.

  * debian/control: Removed build-dependency on sharutils.

  * debian/libplplot5.README.Debian: Added note about pkg-config support.

Commit from airwin (2003-10-26 03:55 CET)
------------------

Initial commit of contributed standard examples from Arjen Markus with some
changes by AWI to allow them to compile.  x17f and x19f don't link (so must
use, e.g, make -k check for now to compile rest of examples) because of
missing fortran API. x18f actually links and gives almost the correct
standard results for example 18, but "almost" means there is probably an API
problem to deal with there.

Commit from airwin (2003-10-26 02:49 CET)
------------------

Drop single-precision support for examples for now.  I intend to re-instate
it later with a sed script.  The *.fm4 are now a misnomer (probably the
name should be changed to *.fdouble or something, but I have to think about
it) since they are no longer processed by m4.  Instead, these files are
filled by straight double-precision fortran (with no embedded m4 commands)
and simply copied to *.f.

Disable dynamic drivers if enable_shared != yes

If the user don't want (or the system is not capable of) to build shared
libraries, then disable dynamic drivers, as they are dynamically loaded
objects.

This must to be done after AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.
There is a test
     if test "$enable_dyndrivers" = "yes"
above that should, if possible, be put after this test.

contain the Octave version 2.*.* in it).  This parallels what is done for
the OCT_M_DIR variable.  OCTAVE_OCT_DIR takes it value from the
octave_config_info structure, being either localoctfiledir (for Octave
version 2.1.*) or the first component of localoctfilepath (version 2.0.*).

The advantage of this change is that the Octave bindings are not tied to a
specific version of Octave, and will continue to be visible if the user
upgrades Octave.  Remember though that there is no guarantee of backward
compatibility of the *.oct API within the unstable series of Octave (2.1.*).

Put AC_CHECK_LIB(ltdl, ...) outside the with_ltdlsystem conditional

For some mysterious reason, when the AC_CHECK_LIB was put inside the
conditional 'if test "$with_ltdlsystem" = no', configure was failing with
the error message: conditional "AMDEP" was never defined.  This should be
fixed now.

Please, test this change.

Preparation for Debian release 5.2.1-20

This will be uploaded to unstable only after version 5.2.1-19 had hit the
testing distribution.

>From debian/changelog:

    * Following a suggestion of Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>, the
      libltdl library shipped with the upstream sources is not compiled
      anymore as a convenience library:
      - Imported configure.ac and Makefile.am from upstream CVS that
        implement the confgiure option --with-ltdlsystem, allowing the use
        of the installed libltdl library.
      - debian/control: Build-depends on libltdl3-dev.
      - debian/rules: Call configure with option --with-ltdlsystem.
    * debian/control:
      - Fixed description of libplplot-dev package.
      - Bumped the build-dependency on debhelper to version 4.1.67, since we
        are using dh_python (thanks again to Matthias Klose for pointing
        this out).

Better logic for use of system's libltdl

The decision about when to use the libltdl library is improved.  Now, the
default is to always compiled the shipped libtool's libltdl as a convenience
library, unless the user explicitly give the option --with-ltdlsystem to
configure.  When this option is given, configure checks if the libltdl
library is actually installed.  If not, it falls back to the convenience
compilation case.

Alan, if you are hearing this, could you please comment?

--------------------

Allow use of installed libltdl

A Debian fellow pointed out to me that there is no need to compile the
libltdl support when building the PLplot Debian packages, since there is a
libltdl3 package against which libplplot can be linked.

In order to be able to disable configuration/compilation of the libltdl
support, I did the following changes:

    * In configure.ac, AC_LIBTOOL_CONVENIENCE and AC_LIBTOOL_INSTALLABLE are
      called conditionally on the presence of an installed libltdl (using
      AC_CHECK_LIB).

    * In order to avoid config/build of the libltdl directory,
      AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS(libltdl) is called conditionally as well.  Also, in
      Makefile.am, the libltdl directory is included conditionally on the
      (newly created) AM_CONDITIONAL variable enable_ltdl_convenience.
      [N.B.: I changed the code for setting the SUBDIRS variable in
      Makefile.am using the automake append (+=) operator, instead of using
      the auxiliary variable drivers_src_dirs as before.]

If the user has libltdl installed in the system but wants to use the version
shipped with PLplot, she can override the configure check by giving the
--enable-ltdl-convenience option (this needs further tests, though).

The advantage of using the system's libltdl are:

    * Configuration time is reduced, since the libltdl dir does not need to
      be configured.
    * Build time is also reduced, for a similar reason.
    * The size of the resulting libplplot library is around 10% smaller (at
      least in Linux).

Fixed problem with sed option -i

Option -i of the sed command is quite useful, because it allows files to be
edited in-place.  It is too bad that GNU sed older than version 4 do not
support this feature.  Since this should be the case for general sed's, the
use of option -i was replaced by an ugly (but working) code using a
temporary file.

pkg-config gives now complete list of dependency libraries

This is a first try to have "pkg-config plplot --libs" working correctly
in a cross-platform way.  For that, the complete list of dependency
libraries flags (-l*) must be included into plplot.pc and plplot-float.pc.

This information is already available in the src/.libs/libplplot*.lai files.
These files are parsed in the install-data-hook rule of pkgcfg/Makefile.am
in a similar way the plplot_libtool script does at run time.  However, this
is done at install time.

This is now the result I am having in Linux (must be also tested in other
platform):

    $ pkg-config plplot --libs
    -lplplotd -lfreetype -lz -lcsirocsa -lcsironn -lqhull -lm -ldl

Commit from airwin (2003-10-10 20:57 CET)
------------------

Update and partial redesign of plplot-config, a simplified wrapper for
plplot_libtool if you don't want to use the power of that script directly.

* fixed bugs where it failed for libtool-1.5 (a linker must be specified),
and also failed for --with-c++ (wrongly named library).

* introduce --with-f77 and --with-tcl options

* non-cumulative library modes.  The idea here is you ordinarily only tell
plplot_libtool about libplplot, and it figures out the correct link options
for the local platform based on that.  However, there are some additional
mutually exclusive options a user can specify:

--with-c++,
--with-f77, or
--with-tcl.

If you specify any of those additional switches you tell plplot_libtool only
about the appropriate library (libplplotcxx for --with-c++, libplplotf77 for
--with-f77, and libplplottcltk for --with-tcl), and it determines the
correct link options for your local platform.  The above switches should be
mutually exclusive, but my scripting skills aren't up to checking for that
(help, please!), but for now I settled for an increasing order of precedence
being in the above order (so anything lower on the list means anything above
is ignored).

Fixed Libs and Cflags entries

Added "/plplot" to the includedir variable, such that there is no need to
explicitly #include <plplot/...> in user programs (this is the case for the
C and C++ examples shiped with PLplot).

Also, removed -DPL_DOUBLE from Cflags (this was producing compilation
warnings, since PL_DOUBLE is already defined in plConfig.h) and removed
@FREETYPELIBCMD@ from Libs.  All the dependecy libraries of libplplot are
guessed by the default linker of Linux.  I am not sure this will work like
this in other Unices.  More work is needed here.

At any rate, compilation of the C examples work correctly now with:

    gcc `pkg-config plplot --cflags` x01c.c -o x01c `pkg-config plplot --libs`

The *_DIR #defines are only needed in plConfg.h, which is included in user
programs.  These #defines are only needed at build time by the core
functions of the PLplot library.  Since they are already included in
config.h (thanks to the AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED calls in configure.ac) and this
later file is included by plConfig.h at build time, then they can be deleted
from plConfig.h.in.

-----------------

If the current directory is in the build tree, change files search order so
as to load them locally.

The modifications guarantee that files/drivers/scripts are loaded from the
build tree if the current directory is somewhere in the build tree.

The objective is that one should be able to change/test/evaluate PLplot
without the necessity of installing it; recently this was needed (and for
some front ends it still is), requiring the user to have a separate
directory to test/change/evaluate PLplot, which means two steps of
configure/make, one with the test --prefix and the other with the final
one, which is confusing and error prone. Also, for developpers, the
make/make install step turns the development cycle sloww and boring.

All the compiled front-ends, C, C++ and F77, was tested and work OK with
all drivers.  The Tcl and Tk front-ends also work OK, but the tk loadable
extensions, Pltk and Plplotter, as well as the tcl extension Pltcl, still
need adjustments in the pkgIndex.tcl script.

The Octave front-end also works OK.

Python and Java was not yet tested.

This is not yet finish, as some problems might yet appear; however, care
has been taken to guarantee that the old behavior still works OK.

Complete reorganization following what is done for
../../bindings/python/Makefile.am.

Note that install-exec-hook: is now used to compile all the installed java
files rather than compiling them in a local directory underneath
bindings/java before installation, and this reduces a lot of clutter that
was occurring before.

Another notable change is the java module that interfaces to PLplot is no
longer built like a full-blown library with a version number, precision tag,
etc. with installation into $prefix/lib with appropriate version number
symlinks.  Instead, it is built similarly to the python module and installed
in the location where the core java and compiled class files are installed.

For PLStreamc.java,  change from

The former requires setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux/Unix systems (ugh, that
is old-fashioned!).

The latter requires an absolute path name + exact name of dynamically loaded
module which is setup in configure.ac and configured using config.java.in.

Yipee! No more setting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH is required for PLplot java use!

Commit from airwin (2003-09-28 07:10 CET)
------------------

As part of dealing with cygwin platform issues I have reconsidered the
autotools chapter on interlibrary dependencies.  The changes here are meant
to follow those precepts more closely along with rules about order of
linking for systems where that matters for static libraries. libtool takes
care of interlibrary dependencies so long as you identify just the
_directly_ dependent libraries using a *.la suffix.  However, for
interdependent system libraries which are (quite possibly) not linked by
libtool you cannot rely on this mechanism to keep track of the library
dependencies so it is necessary to mention _all_ interdependent system
libraries in the correct order on the libtool line when any one of them
is referred to.

* The order of interdependent system libraries is libitk, libtk, libitcl,
libtcl, libX11, libm, and all changes here involve those libraries.

* If libitk is referred to you must also mention libtk.

* If libtk is referred to you must also mention libtcl, libX11 and libm.

* If libtcl is referred to you must also mention libm.  (This fixes an
AIX problem mentioned some time ago for libtclmatrix.)

* if libX11 is referred to you must also mention libm.

The fixes here make no essential difference on Linux, but they are expected
to reduce linking errors on Unix platforms.

--------------------

In the check for the Swig version, removed code for sed that was too GNUish.
The check could now be much more portable.

Also, Added a pair of AC_MSG_CHECKING/AC_MSG_RESULT around the version
number check.  In the configure output, something like this will appear now:

    checking Swig version... 1.3.17u-20021128-1508

[ This makes me remember that we should add similar things at some other
  places in configure.ac and sysloc.in.  I have also spotted some improper
  uses of AC_MSG_RESULT, but this will be fixed when time permits. ]

Finally, the robustness of the code has been improved.  In particular, if
something went wrong with the setting of teh variable SWIG_VERSION_MICRO,
then configure choked when doing an arithmetic expansion $(( ... )).  This
is fixed now.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-09-20 10:00 CET)
--------------------

Quick hack to avoid garbage being stored in the reconfig script when
configure is called recursively with the --fallback-echo option (for
instance, this happens for the checks of maximum command length by the
libtool configuration).

This problem made surface now that we decided to use Libtool 1.5 instead of
1.4.  However, it could have arisen before, because the --falback option and
the implicit rule that the configure script can be called recursively using
this option have always been present in autoconf. In sum, we might try in
the future to restructure configure.ac, in particular rethinking about the
non-orthodox stuff before AC_INIT.

At any rate, the generation of the reconfig script has been superseded by
"./config.status --recheck".

  plplot  configure.ac  1.102


Commit from rlaboiss (2003-09-19 10:23 CET)
--------------------

The robustness of the macro has been improved.  If GET_DLNAME is called
before AC_LIBTOOL_PROG, the configure script will exit now with an
appropriate error message.  This is not intended for general users, but only
for developers who make changes to configure.ac.

Some comments about the last changes done by Alan:

In the GET_DLNAME macro, $LD was changed to $CC as the command when invoking
libtool --mode=link. Actually, the name of this command is irrelevant to the
actions taken by the libtool script.  However, in version 1.5 (or 1.5.0a) of
libtool, the name is used to guess a "tagged configuration", in case the
option --tag has not been specified.  Using $LD would then trigger an error.
I hope that this macro will be portable across different platforms. The
future will tell us.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-09-18 09:16 CET)
--------------------

Added the macro GET_DLNAME(STEM,VERSION_INFO,VARIABLE) to guess the dlname
of a library to be installed by libtool.

For instance, if the following code is used in configure.ac:

    GET_DLNAME([plplottcltk$LIB_TAG], [$SOVERSION], [DLNAME_TCL])
    echo $DLNAME_TCL

it will produce:

    libplplottcltkd.so.5

Notice that the code above will work only if placed after the call to
AM_PROG_LIBTOOL and the definitions of $SOVERSION and $LIB_TAG.

Fixed character size inconsistency with corresponding C example by putting
in missing call to pls-->schr.  Postscript results are now identical. Only
remaining differences with C examples are for x04, x16, and x21, and those
differences are so subtle they cannot be seen visually (similar to java
versus C differences or platform differences).  Probably, these subtle
issues are due to some floating-point logic issues deep in the core of
Plplot that are triggered by slightly different order of computations in the
various platforms/front-end languages.  One candidate for that deep issue is
the 16-bit resolution of the various drivers so when Geoffrey generalizes
this to the option of 32-bit (or even 64 bit) we may see all these subtle
differences between platforms/languages go away.

Configure

HAVE_FINITE
HAVE_ISINF
HAVE_ISNAN
HAVE_UNISTD_H
HAVE_USLEEP

following exactly what is done in config.h.in in the top-level directory.

These #defines are all used in the examples and must be compiled using the
installed system (which does not have access to configured config.h results).

------------------

AWI for Andrew Ross <andrewr@coriolis.greenend.org.uk> who kindly updated
the C++ interface (under the LGPL) to bring it into the modern era.  At
least 13 API additions were made.

N.B. the method of initializing plplot under the C++ interface has been
changed. So this is an API breakage, but it allows, for example, the user to
use command-line options for the first time for that interface.  Also, an
extensive set of C++ examples (clones of the corresponding C/python/java/tcl
examples) have been committed that use the updated C++ interface so it
should not be a difficult change for the user to make.

Take advantage of command-line options that are now available for C++.
Also, do all the new C++ examples.

Commit from airwin (2003-09-02 03:38 CET)

Replace mv by mv -f in install-hook.  This should work better cross-platform
for the case where you are installing on top of an area where plplot was
installed before.

options now work!

Commit from airwin (2003-09-02 03:26 CET)
------------------

AWI for Andrew Ross <andrewr@coriolis.greenend.org.uk>.  Andrew kindly
donated these clones of the C/python/java/tcl examples under the LGPL.

I added the appropriate copyright line and (LGPL) copying conditions. I also
removed java commentary that had been inadvertently copied for x01.cc from
the java example.  I also temporarily disabled the HAVE_USLEEP code in
x01.cc and x17.cc which does not work on Linux (at least on my Debian stable
system).  Another issue is that x02, x04, x16, and x21 produce different
results than the corresponding C examples.  There is an obvious problem for
the second example, but the rest are subtle as in similar differences I
find between java and c.  The good news is that the rest of the
examples produce identical to C results which is a pretty good test that
the C++ interface has now entered the modern era.

Thanks Andrew!

Created a new AC_SUBSTitutable variable RELEASE_DATE in configure.ac.  This
variable is automatically set in ISO 6801 formant (YYYY-MM-DD) by the
bootstrap.sh script when options --version or --date-version are specified.
For now, only plplotdoc.xml.in is using it, fixing that long-lasting bug in
the "Release date" of the documentation.

--------------------

* Added year 2002 for copyright entry of Alan and Rafael.

* Fixed the Project-Date entity, which contains now the RCS keyword "Date",
  and must be updated with CVS keyword substitution.  This is not a
  completely satisfactory solution, because the "Date" keyword reflects only
  the date of the last CVS checkin of the present file.  We ought to find a
  way to update automatically the date of release of the documentation.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-25 01:06 CET)
--------------------


Debian release 5.2.1-17.  From the changelog:

  * Rebuilt against the new python2.3-dev itcl/itk 3.2 and iwidgets4
    packages.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.
    - Bumped build-dependencies to python2.3, itcl3, and itk3.
    - plplot-tcl depends now on iwidgets4.
  * sysloc.in, configure.ac: Using patched version from CVS upstream with
    fixes in the Python configuration and in the list of include
    directories to find files itcl.h and itk.h.
  * Used new CVS upstream version of the documentation files with
    legacy license statement removed.  A new .orig.tar.gz was generated,
    since it was impossible to patch binary files, like plplot-5.2.1.pdf.
    The plplot-doc package is now DFSG compliant (closes: #202761).
  * utils/plrender.c: Patched from CVS upstream.  From the commit log:
    Comment out call to plSetInternalOpt which uses the tcl_cmd option
    that has been disabled in plargs.c.  This fix solves the plrender
    memory management problems and the crashes associated with plrender
    and device tk.

Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-24 22:59 CET)
--------------------

Changed the license terms for the PLplot Documentation, which is now like
the FreeBSD Documentation License.  The changes:

  * Changed the text of <legalnotice> in plplotdoc.xml.in (and also fixed
    some typos in <copyright>, like Joao's name appearing twice).

  *  Added a comment at the top of each xml and dsl file containing the
     whole text of the license.

  * Added the file doc/docbook/COPYING.  It is included in EXTRA_DIST of
    file doc/docbook/Makefile.am and will appear in the source documentation
    tarball, generated in doc/docbook/src/Makefile.am.

  * Added Joao Cardoso in the doc/docbook/AUTHORS list.

  * Fixed LGPL licensing text in some files.

Commit from mlebrun (2003-08-24 21:44 CET)
-------------------

Re-enabled setting of the tcl_cmd internal opt.  Only affects plrender -dev
tk, by adding a "back arrow" button for going backward in metafile.
Previously this did not work correctly due to a problem with plargs.c, now
fixed.

Commit from mlebrun (2003-08-24 21:42 CET)
-------------------

plstrdup() tcl_cmd string instead of copying the pointer, and remove
(disabled) status from help entry.

  plplot  src/plargs.c  1.64


Commit from mlebrun (2003-08-24 19:01 CET)
-------------------

Many more improvements to fill clipping.  Handle cases where fill polygon
intersects bounding box on two edges by calculating the approximate
circulation of the contour and filling in the edge vertices appropriately.
With these changes the clipping performs accurately up to reasonably high
levels of zooming using x16c as a test case.  At some point (as one continues
to zoom in) it starts to have problems, which I suspect to be a problem in
clipline() or related to fidelity (or both).  Further work on this will have
to wait, as for now I'm out of time.

  plplot  src/plline.c  1.29


Commit from mlebrun (2003-08-24 12:44 CET)
-------------------

More updates to polygon fill: fixed a couple bugs with the previous change,
structural changes to make this easier to understand/modify.

  plplot  src/plline.c  1.28


Commit from mlebrun (2003-08-24 00:56 CET)
-------------------

Correctly treat the case where one or two corners are encircled by the polygon
fill.  I gave up on this problem 9 years ago but it's actually not that bad.
A good test case: run "x16c -dev tk", zoom in on a smallish region, then start
panning around.  An incorrectly clipped region at one of the corners should
soon appear.  This change fixes most occurances of that.

Still todo: handle the encircling

  plplot  src/plline.c  1.27


Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-23 11:04 CET)
--------------------

Added /usr/include/tcl8.4* directories to the incdirs_default list.  Without
this, configure fails to find itcl.h and itk.h when PLplot is built against
itcl/itk 3.2 (at least in Debian).

  plplot  sysloc.in  1.49


Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-16 19:10 CET)
--------------------

If a specific version of Python is present in the system, but the header
file has not be found in {$prefix,/usr}/include/python$PYTHON_VERSION/, then
the following loud warning message is issued:

configure: WARNING: Header file for Python version 2.3 has not been found.
configure: WARNING: This probably means that an appropriate Python
configure: WARNING: development package needs to be installed.

(Aside note: we should replace in configure.ac and sysloc.in all the
instances of AC_MSG_RESULT by AC_MSG_WARN, when warning messages are
issued.)

  plplot  sysloc.in  1.48


Commit from airwin (2003-08-16 17:46 CET)
------------------

Comment out call to plSetInternalOpt which uses the tcl_cmd option that
has been disabled in plargs.c.  This fix solves the plrender memory
management problems (diagnosed by valgrind) and the crashes associated
with plrender and device tk.  Maurice may eventually reinstate the tcl_cmd
option in both plargs.c and plrender.c.

  plplot  utils/plrender.c  1.61


Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-16 15:53 CET)
--------------------

Oops, the last commit have accidentally removed the scripts/plplot-config
entry from AC_CONFIG_FILES.  Putting it back.

  plplot  configure.ac  1.96


Commit from rlaboiss (2003-08-16 15:39 CET)
--------------------

In sysloc.in, changed the list of directories to search for Python headers
(when setting the PYTHON_INC_DIR variable) to have just:

        $prefix/include/python$PYTHON_VERSION
        /usr/include/python$PYTHON_VERSION

instead of a long list of all possible Python versioned include dirs.

This change requires that the call to AM_PATH_PYTHON be made before
AC_INCLUDE(sysloc.in), in configure.in.

Also, an additional sanity check for non-emptiness of the PYTHON_VERSION
variable is added to sysloc.in, right at the beginning of the Python
configuration section.

AWI for Rafael Laboissiere: make bootstrap.sh still work with libtool-1.4
(although we should remove this as soon as we are all using libtool-1.5).

  plplot  bootstrap.sh  1.22


Commit from airwin (2003-07-30 01:50 CET)
------------------

Remove two lines from script (cp configure.in configure.ac and rm -f
configure.ac in the libltdl subdirectory) that were causing problems for
libtool-1.5 (which has a file called configure.ac in this subdirectory).
I believe this change is still backwards-compatible with libtool-1.4.x,
but if not it should be possible to reinstate in a way that does not screw up
libtool-1.5.
