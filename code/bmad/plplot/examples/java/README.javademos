These java examples are designed to mimic the results of the equivalent
C, Tcl, and Python examples.

Here is the cookbook for compiling and running these examples.

(1) Install a Java SDK (Software Development Kit).  I use
IBMJava2-SDK-14.tgz which is freely downloadable from IBM.  (See
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/tested.html for product
description.) Plplot is also known to work with the Sun JDK, gcj/gij and
jikes/sablevm. Ensure that java and javac are in your PATH.

(2) If the java include files are not in a default include directory then
you need to tell configure where they are. You can either use the
--with-java-home option to set the SDK directory e.g.
./configure --with-java-home=/home/software/java/IBMJava2-14/
Previously this was done via the environment variables JAVA_HOME, which
still works for backwards compatibility.

(3) Run java demos

All the plplot java bindings and default examples are contained in the
jar file plplot.jar. This needs to be accessible to java either by setting
CLASSPATH or by using the -classpath option to java. For example :-

# For newer jdk's can use the plplot/examples/x?? notation, but the dot
# notation works for all jdk's.

# This location will depend on your install prefix:
setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/share/java/plplot.jar
java plplot.examples.x01 .....

If you want to see the source code for the examples it can be found in
the jar file /usr/local/share/java/plplot.jar and also in
/usr/local/share/plplot5.3.1/examples/java/

(4) Changing and recompiling java demos

If you want to alter and recompile the examples you can use the version in
e.g. /usr/local/share/plplot5.3.1/examples/java. After altering the java
file run "make" to rebuild the classes. When you run these examples you
need to ensure that the examples/java directory appears _before_ the
plplot.jar file in your class path otherwise java will use the default
version and not your modified version.
