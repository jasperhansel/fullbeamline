# Run standard examples using wish TEA-based approach.
# Drop examples 14 and 31 because querying for devices does not
# seem to work in this context.
# The following exec command reexecutes the script under wish.  This
# is possible because all comment lines are ignored by wish including
# continued ones with a trailing backslash like this one \

# Note wish currently disables pauses so no special method is
# required to do that (unlike the plserver case).
