These C++ examples exactly replicate the C examples but using the C++
plstream class.

The examples are written to work on a fairly modern C++ compiler. They
are known to work with gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.3.3 for example.

The examples make use of the std namespace feature. This may cause some
difficulties on older compilers. You may need to comment out the line
"using namespace std;" near the top of the file in this case.

We have had reports of other problems on some versions of the IRIX
compilers because they do not include the standard header file
cstdlib. In this case you may need to include stdlib.h instead.

If you encounter any other problems please report them.
