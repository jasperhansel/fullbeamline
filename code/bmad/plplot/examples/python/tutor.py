# This program is intended to be used as a template for creating simple
# two-dimensional plotting programs which use the PLplot plotting
# library.  The program was written with an emphasis on trying to clearly
# illustrate how to use the PLplot library functions.
#
# This program reads data for M lines with N points each from an input
# data file and plots them on the same graph using different symbols.  It
# draws axes with labels and places a title at the top of the figure.  A
# legend is drawn to the right of the figure.  The input data file must
# have the following format:
#
#    x[1]     x[2]        x[3]        .     .     .     x[N]
#    y1[1]    y1[2]       y1[3]       .     .     .     y1[N]
#    y2[1]    y2[2]       y2[3]       .     .     .     y2[N]
#     .          .           .        .     .     .        .
#     .          .           .        .     .     .        .
#     .          .           .        .     .     .        .
#    yM[1]     yM[2]      yM[3]       .     .     .     yM[N]
#
# For example:
#
#	0	1	2	3	4
#	1.2	1.5	1.6	1.9	2.0
#	1.1	1.3	1.8	2.1	2.3
#	1.3	1.6	1.8	2.0	2.2
#
# (The first line contains the x-coordinates.  The succeeding M lines
# contain the y-coordinates of each of the M lines.)
