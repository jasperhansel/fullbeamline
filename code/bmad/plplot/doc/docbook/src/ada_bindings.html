    and as such are a kind of abstract layer between the user's code and the
    PLplot binary library. Additionally, there are a few capabilities not in
    the official API but nonetheless which are available to the C programmer
    which are included in the bindings and thus are directly available to the
    Ada programmer.</p><p>The thin binding is a layer between the thick bindings and the
    underlying C code. It is mainly a programming convenience for the
    developer of the bindings; this is a common implementation for foreign
    language bindings and for the most part, the user can ignore it.</p><p>There are two thick bindings provided for the convenience of the
    user. Either may be used and they both provide exactly the same
    functionality. The thick bindings are the user's main concern with
    programming for PLplot.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_thin"></a>Thin Binding</h3></div></div></div><p>The thin binding, in the files <code class="literal">plplotthin.ads</code>
      and <code class="literal">plplotthin.adb</code>, is mostly a direct and obvious
      mapping of the C application programming interface (API) to Ada. Thus,
      for example, where a C program such as <code class="literal">plcol0</code>
      requires a single integer argument, there is a corresponding Ada program
      also called <code class="literal">plcol0</code> which also requires a single
      integer argument. (<code class="literal">plcol0</code> happens to set the drawing
      color using a number which is associated with a set of colors.) Various
      constants from the C API are also included here. Numeric types as
      defined in PLplot are associated with numeric types in Ada in the thin
      binding by use of Ada's type system. Thus, the thin binding refers to
      the PLplot-centric type <code class="literal">PLFLT</code> for floating-point
      types while the thick binding uses the usual Ada type
      <code class="literal">Long_Float</code>.</p><p>Many of the comments from the C source header file (similar in
      purpose to an Ada specification file) have been retained in the thin
      binding, even when they are no longer make sense. These might be pruned at
      some point to facilitate reading the Ada source.</p><p>Also included in the thin binding are some other declarations
      which help the Ada binding to mesh well with C by emulating certain data
      structures which are needed in some rather specialized usages as well as
      providing certain subprogram pointer types.</p><p>The Ada programmer working with either of the thick bindings will
      have to refer to the thin binding relatively rarely, if ever, and mainly
      to examine the subroutine pointer declarations and the several variant
      record types which are used mostly for contour and three-dimensional
      plots. However, some of these have been <code class="literal">subtype</code>-ed or
      <code class="literal">renames</code>-ed in the thick bindings so even less
      reference to the thin binding will be necessary. The goal is to put
      everything of interest to the user in the thick bindings and the user
      need not bother with the thin binding.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_thick"></a>The Thick Bindings</h3></div></div></div><p>The thick bindings provide most of the information that the Ada
      programmer needs. Normally, only one of the two thick bindings would be
      used per user program but it should be possible to include both but that
      scenario would be unusual.</p><p>There are three main aspects of the thick bindings: providing an
      alternative access to the PLplot API, extending the PLplot functionality
      with some easy-to-use features, and overlaying Ada data structures and
      types.</p><p>In the first aspect, the thick bindings provide a fully Ada
      interface to the entire PLplot library. Packages are
      <code class="literal">with</code>-ed and <code class="literal">use</code>-d as normal Ada
      code. Ada arrays can be passed as usual, not requiring the array length
      or start or end indices to be passed separately. All necessary Ada types
      are made to match the underlying C types exactly.</p><p>The second aspect of the thick bindings is to provide some
      simplified ways to get a lot of plotting done with only one or two
      subroutine calls. For example, a single call to Simple_Plot can display
      from one to five "<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>'s" as a function of a single
      "<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>" with default plot appearances chosen to suit
      many situations. Other simple plotters are available for
      three-dimensional and contour plots. Manipulating PLplot's colors is
      similarly made easy and some default color schemes are provided.</p><p>The third main aspect of the thick binding is to use Ada data
      structures and Ada's type system extensively to reduce the chances of
      inappropriate actions. For example, Ada arrays are used throughout (as
      opposed to C's
      pointer-plus-offset-while-carrying-along-the-size-separately approach).
      Quantities which have natural range limits are
      <code class="literal">subtype</code>-d to reflect those constraints. The hope is
      that program errors will result in more-familiar Ada compilation or
      run-time errors rather than error reports from the PLplot library or no
      reports at all. However, there remain a few instances where the typing
      could be improved and PLplot errors will still be reported from time to
      time.</p><p>Both the specification and body for the standard thick (and thin)
      binding contain the C subroutine name as a comment line immediately
      above the Ada procedure declaration; this should help in making the
      associations between "Ada" names and "PLplot" names. Also, the
      subroutine-specific comments from the C API have been retained
      verbatim.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_thick_enhanced"></a>Standard Thick Binding Using Enhanced Names</h3></div></div></div><p>The distinguishing feature of this thick binding (the "standard"
      binding) is to provide more descriptive names for PLplot subroutines,
      variables, constants, arguments, and other objects. Most Ada programmers
      will be more comfortable using these names. For example, in the C API as
      well as the thin Ada binding and the other thick Ada binding, the
      procedure <code class="literal">plcol0(1)</code> sets the drawing color to red. In
      the standard thick binding, the same thing is accomplished by writing
      <code class="literal">Set_Pen_Color(Red)</code>. The Ada program may just as well
      write <code class="literal">Set_Pen_Color(1)</code> since the binding merely sets
      a constant <code class="literal">Red</code> to be equal to the integer
      <code class="literal">1</code>. Many such numeric constants from the C API are
      given names in this thick binding. These renamed integers are discussed
      more fully in Section 7.2.</p><p>The disadvantage of this renaming is that it makes referring to
      the PLplot documentation somewhat awkward. There might be, at some time,
      a utility for easing this problem by providing an HTML file with links
      so that a "normal" PLplot name can be linked to the "Ada" name along
      with the appropriate entry in the Ada specification, as well as another
      HTML file with links from the "Ada" name directly to the PLplot web page
      that documents that name. It might also be possible to provide an
      alternate version of the documentation with the enhanced names used.
      (The developer of the bindings has a sed file prepared which makes most
      of the subroutine-name substitutions.) However, this thick binding
      retains the original C subprogram names as comments immediately above
      the function or procedure name in the code listing so it is relatively
      easy to locate the relevant item in the PLplot documentation.</p><p>One simple rule applies in reading the PLplot API documentation:
      the argument names are in the same order in Ada as in the PLplot
      documentation (the names are different) except that all array lengths
      are eliminated. The PLplot documentation, for each subroutine, shows a
      "redacted" version which should be correct for Ada as well as other
      languages which have proper arrays.</p><p>The standard bindings are in the Ada files
      <code class="literal">plplot.ads</code> and <code class="literal">plplot.adb</code>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_thick_traditional"></a>Thick Binding Using Traditional Names</h3></div></div></div><p>This thick binding provides exactly the same functionality as the
