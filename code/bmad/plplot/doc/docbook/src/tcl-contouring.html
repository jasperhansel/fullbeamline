      Contouring and shading has traditionally been one of the
      messier things to do in PLplot.  The C API has many parameters, with
      complex setup and tear down properties.  Of special concern is that
      some of the parameters do not have a natural representation in script
      languages like Tcl.  In this section we describe how the Tcl
      interface to these facilities is provided, and how to use it.
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tcl-drawing-contour"></a>Drawing a Contour Plot from Tcl</h3></div></div></div><p>
	By way of reference, the primary C function call for contouring is:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	void plcont( PLFLT **f, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLINT kx, PLINT lx,
	PLINT ky, PLINT ly, PLFLT *clevel, PLINT nlevel,
	void (*pltr) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER),
	PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER pltr_data);
      </pre><p>
      </p><p>
	This is a fairly complex argument list, and so for this function (and
	for plshade, described below) we dispense with trying to exactly
	mirror the C API, and just concentrate on capturing the functionality
	within a Tcl context.  To begin with, the data is provided through a
	2-d Tcl matrix.  The Tcl matrix carries along its size information
	with it, so <code class="literal">nx</code> and <code class="literal">ny</code> are no longer needed.  The
	<code class="literal">kx</code>, <code class="literal">lx</code>, <code class="literal">ky</code> and
	<code class="literal">ly</code> variables are
	potentially still  useful for plotting a subdomain of the full data
	set, so they may be specified in the natural way, but we make this
	optional since they are frequently not used to convey anything more
	than what could be inferred from <code class="literal">nx</code> and
	<code class="literal">ny</code>.  However, to
	simplify processing, they must be supplied or omitted as a set (all of
	them, or none of them).  <code class="literal">clevel</code> is supplied as a 1-d Tcl
	matrix, and so <code class="literal">nlevel</code> can be omitted.
      </p><p>
	Finally, we have no way to support function pointers from Tcl, so
	instead we provide token based support for accessing the three
	coordinate transformation routines which are provided by PLplot, and
	which many PLplot users use.  There are thus three courses of action:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Provide no pltr specification.  In this case, <code class="literal">pltr0</code> is
	      used by default.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Specify <code class="literal">pltr1 x y</code> where x and y are 1-d Tcl matrices.
	      In this case <code class="literal">pltr1</code> will be used, and the 1-d arrays which it
	      needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices <code class="literal">x</code> and
	      <code class="literal">y</code>.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Specify <code class="literal">pltr2 x y</code> where x and y are 2-d Tcl matrices.
	      In this case <code class="literal">pltr2</code> will be used, and the 2-d arrays which it
	      needs will be supplied from the Tcl matrices <code class="literal">x</code> and
	      <code class="literal">y</code>.
	    </p></li></ul></div><p>

      </p><p>
	Now, there can be no question that this is both more concise and less
	powerful than what you could get in C.  The loss of the ability to
	provide a user specified transformation function is regrettable.  If
	you really do need that functionality, you will have to implement your
	own Tcl extension command to do pretty much the same thing as the
	provided Tcl extension command <code class="literal">plcont</code> (which is in
	<code class="filename">tclAPI.c</code> in function <code class="literal">plcontCmd()</code>), except specify the C
	transformation function of your choice.
      </p><p>
	However, that having been said, we recognize that one common use for
	this capability is to provide a special version of <code class="literal">pltr2</code> which
	knows how to implement a periodic boundary condition, so that polar
	plots, for example, can be implemented cleanly.  That is, if you want
	to draw contours of a polar data set defined on a 64 x 64 grid,
	ensuring that contour lines would actually go all the way around the
	origin rather than breaking off like a silly pacman figure, then you
	had basically two choices in C.  You could copy the data to a 65 x 64
	grid, and replicate one row of data into the spare slot, and then plot
	the larger data set (taking care to replicate the coordinate arrays
	you passed to pltr2 in the same way), <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> you could make a
	special version of <code class="literal">pltr2</code> which would understand that one of the
	coordinates was wrapped, and perform transformations accordingly
	without actually making you replicate the data.
      </p><p>
	Since the former option is ugly in general, and hard to do in Tcl in
	particular, and since the second option is even more difficult to do
	in Tcl (requiring you do make a special Tcl extension command as
	described above), we provide special, explicit support for this common
	activity.  This is provided through the use of a new, optional
	parameter <code class="literal">wrap</code> which may be specified as the last parameter to
	the Tcl command, only if you are using <code class="literal">pltr2</code>.  Supplying
	<code class="literal">1</code> will wrap in the first coordinate, <code class="literal">2</code> will wrap in the
	second coordinate.
      </p><p>
	The resultant Tcl command is:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	plcont f [kx lx ky ly] clev [pltr x y] [wrap]
      </pre><p>
	Note that the brackets here are used to signify optional arguments,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to represent Tcl command substitution!
      </p><p>
	The Tcl demo <code class="filename">x09.tcl</code> provides examples of all the capabilities
	of this interface to contouring from Tcl.  Note in particular,
	<code class="literal">x09_polar</code> which does a polar contour without doing anything
	complicated in the way of setup, and without getting a pacman as the
	output.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tcl-drawing-shaded"></a>Drawing a Shaded Plot from Tcl</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The Tcl interface to shading works very much like the one for
	contouring.  The command is:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	plshade z xmin xmax ymin ymax \
	sh_min sh_max sh_cmap sh_color sh_width \
	min_col min_wid max_col max_wid \
	rect [pltr x y] [wrap]
      </pre><p>
	where <code class="literal">nx</code> and <code class="literal">ny</code> were dropped since they are inferred
	from the Tcl matrix <code class="literal">z</code>, <code class="literal">defined</code> was dropped since it
	isn't supported anyway, and <code class="literal">plfill</code> was dropped since it was the
	only valid choice anyway.  The <code class="literal">pltr</code> spec and
	<code class="literal">wrap</code> work
	exactly as described for the Tcl <code class="literal">plcont</code> described above.
      </p><p>
	The Tcl demo <code class="filename">x16.tcl</code> contains extensive demonstrations of use,
	including a shaded polar plot which connects in the desirable way
	without requiring special data preparation, again just like for
	<code class="literal">plcont</code> described previously.
