    This chapter provides some information on the issue of
    delivering programs that use PLplot: what files should be installed and
    where, what environment variables are involved and related matters.
  </p><p>
    The scenario is this: You have created one or more programs that run
    successfully on your development machine and now you need to install
    them on the machine of a user.
  </p><p>
    One solution is to provide him or her with the full development
    environment that you use, but that is in general only an option if your
    user is comfortable with making programs themselves. A more common
    situation is that your user just wants the executable programs and
    wants to get using them right away. We will focus on this particular
    solution, as there are a few non-trivial issues.
  </p><p>
    To be absolutely clear about what we are describing, here is a summary:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Your program must run on a machine that does not have PLplot
	  installed from the sources.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  There is no development environment that you can rely on.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  The program should be installed in a self-contained directory
	  structure (which <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
	  <code class="filename">/usr/local</code> or <code class="filename">c:\program</code>
	  files or whatever, but need not be so).
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    Under Linux, the easiest way to install a binary version of PLplot on a
    user's machine is to use PLplot deb binary packages for the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org" target="_top">Debian</a> distribution, and PLplot rpm
    binary packages for rpm-based distributions. (See the <a class="ulink" href="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/download.php" target="_top">download
    area</a> of the PLplot web site for locations of debs and rpms.)
    Build the application on the build machine using the results of the
    <strong class="userinput"><code>pkg-config --cflags --libs plplotd</code></strong> command, and copy
    the resulting executable(s) to the users' machines.
  </p><p>
    Under Unix (and also under Linux if you would prefer to use a newer
    version of PLplot than is available in the debs or rpms), a good way
    to deploy binary PLplot and applications that depend on that binary PLplot
    on users' machines is as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Use the <span class="command"><strong>cmake</strong></span> option
	  <strong class="userinput"><code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/plplot</code></strong> (or some other
	  unique but consistent directory that is available on the build
	  machine and all users' machines).
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Build and install as normal on the build machine.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Copy the installed PLplot tree,
	  <code class="filename">/usr/local/plplot</code>, into a tarball.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Unpack that tarball on all users' machines in the same location
	  <code class="filename">/usr/local/plplot</code>.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Build the application(s) on the build machine using either the
	  make or cmake based build system in
	  /usr/local/plplot/share/plplotX.Y.Z/examples where X.Y.Z is
	  the plplot version, and copy the resulting executable(s) to the users'
	  machines.  Since the PLplot install location is consistent on all
	  machines, the application should work the same way on all
	  machines.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    On Windows, and also those rare Linux/Unix cases where you cannot install
    the PLplot install tree in a consistent location on users' machines, then
    there are some additional options you need to consider.
  </p><p>
    There are three situations depending on how you configure and
    build the PLplot libraries:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
	  You use the static versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
	  which are not dynamically loaded.
	  <a href="#ftn.idp44455744" class="footnote" name="idp44455744"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  You use the shared versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
	  which are not dynamically loaded.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  You use the shared versions of the PLplot library and devices
	  which are dynamically loaded.  This combination is the default
	  option under Unix/Linux.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>
  </p><p>
    In the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> case the program will contain all the
    code it needs to work, but to run successfully, it needs to find the
    font files, <code class="filename">plstnd5.fnt</code> and
    <code class="filename">plxtnd5.fnt</code>. The mechanism used in PLplot to find
    these files is fairly simple:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  It looks at a number of built-in places, determined at the time
	  the PLplot library itself was installed and built. For deployment
	  these places are irrelevant in general.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  It looks at the environment variables
	  <code class="envar">PLPLOT_LIB</code> and <code class="envar">PLPLOT_HOME</code>.
	  (Actually, this happens only, if the corresponding compiler
	  macros <code class="envar">PLPLOT_LIB_ENV</code> and
	  <code class="envar">PLPLOT_HOME_ENV</code> were defined at compile time.)
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>(TODO: remark about Mac)</em></span>
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    Note: This is also the place to put the geographical map files, if you
    happen to use them.
  </p><p>
    The environment variables should point to the directory holding the two
    font files or the one above (one variable is enough though):
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="envar">PLPLOT_LIB</code> should point to the directory
	  actually holding these files
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="envar">PLPLOT_HOME</code> should point to the directory that
	  holds a subdirectory <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="filename">lib</code></span>”</span>
	  which in turn holds these files.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    If it can find these, PLplot can do its job.
  </p><p>
    Note: This is the case for instance when you use the static PLplot
    library on Windows (see the directory
    <code class="filename">sys\win32\msdev\plplib</code>).
  </p><p>
    In the <span class="emphasis"><em>second </em></span> case the font and map files are found
    as in the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> case.  In addition, you also
    require another environment variable so the PLplot shared libraries can
    be found at run time by the run-time loader.  The details depend on the
    system you are working on, but here are some common platforms:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Most UNIX, BSD and Linux systems use an environment variable
	  <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> which indicates
	  directories where shared libraries can be found. Some use
	  <code class="envar">SHLIB_PATH</code>, like HPUX.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  On Windows the PATH variable is used to find the DLLs, but
	  beware: Windows uses a number of places to find the DLLs a
	  program needs and the ordering seems to depend on some intricate
	  details. It seems easiest and safest to put the DLLs in the same
	  directory as your program.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  On MacOSX, ... <span class="emphasis"><em>TODO</em></span>
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    In the <span class="emphasis"><em>third</em></span> (default) case, the PLplot fonts and
    maps are found as in the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> case, and the
    shared libraries are found as in the <span class="emphasis"><em>second</em></span> case,
    but in addition the separated dynamic devices have to be found as well.
  </p><p>
    When PLplot uses dynamic devices, it first builds up a list of them, by
    examining a directory which contains files describing those devices:
    the <code class="filename">*.driver_info</code> files. Each of these files indicates what
    the relevant properties for the device or devices. Then when the
    device is actually needed, the corresponding shared object (or plug-in
    or DLL depending on your terminology) is dynamically loaded.
  </p><p>
    The directory that contains all these files (the device descriptions as
    well as the actual libraries and the description files that libtool
    uses) is a directory determined at the time you configured
    PLplot which is typically something like
    <code class="filename">/usr/local/plplot/lib/plplot5.3.1/driversd</code>.  This
    directory must be pointed to by the <code class="envar">PLPLOT_DRV_DIR</code>
    environment variable. Again for deployment, only the environment
    variable is of real interest.
  </p><p>
    To summarize the case where you don't have a deb or rpm option, and
    you must use inconsistent install locations on your users' machines:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  The following environment variables are important:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
		<code class="envar">PLPLOT_HOME</code> or
		<code class="envar">PLPLOT_LIB</code> to indicate the position of
		font files (and also of the various geographic maps)
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		<code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>,
		<code class="envar">SHLIB_PATH</code> or <code class="envar">PATH</code> to
		find the dynamic/shared libraries
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		<code class="envar">PLPLOT_DRV_DIR</code> to find the device
		descriptions
	      </p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  The following files being part of PLplot must be distributed
	  along with your program:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
		The font files (<code class="filename">plstnd5.fnt</code> and
		<code class="filename">plxtnd5.fnt</code>) and, possibly, if you use
		them, the geographic map files.
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		The PLplot shared libraries
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		The device description files and the device shared object files
	      </p></li></ul></div><p>
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    All the environment variables, except
    <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and equivalents, can be set within
    the program (by using a small configuration file or by determining the
    position of the files relative to the program's location). They just
    have be set before PLplot is initialized.
  </p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0"><div id="ftn.idp44455744" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idp44455744" class="para"><sup class="para">[1] </sup></a>
	      UNIX-like systems libraries can be static or shared, the first
	      type becoming part of the program, the second existing as a
	      separate file. On Windows the terms are respectively static
	      and dynamic (the latter type is also known as DLL).
