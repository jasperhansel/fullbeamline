      By this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of the
      underlying philosophy of Tcl and Tk, and the whole concept of
      extensions, of which [incr Tcl] and PLplot are examples.  These alone
      are enough to allow the rapid prototyping and development of
      powerful, flexible graphical applications.  Normally the programmer
      simply writes a shell script to be executed by the Tk windowing
      shell, <span class="command"><strong>wish</strong></span>.  It is in vogue for each Tcl/Tk
      extension package to build it's own <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">extended WISH</span>”</span>.
      There are many examples of this, and indeed even PLplot's
      <span class="command"><strong>plserver</strong></span> program, described in an earlier chapter,
      could just as easily have been called <span class="command"><strong>plwish</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      In any event, as exciting and useful as these standalone, extended
      windowing shells may be, they are ultimately only the beginning of
      what you can do.  The real benefit of this approach is realized when
      you make your own <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">extended WISH</span>”</span>, comprised of Tcl, Tk,
      any of the standard extensions you like, and finally embellished with
      a smattering of application specific extensions designed to support
      your own application domain.  In this section we give a detailed
      introduction to the process of constructing your own WISH.  After
      that, you're on your own...
    </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="wish-construction"></a>WISH Construction</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The standard way to make your own WISH, as supported by the Tcl/Tk
	system, is to take a boilerplate file,
	<code class="filename">tkAppInit.c</code>, edit to reflect the Tcl/Tk
	extensions you will be requiring, add some commands to the
	interpreter, and link it all together.
      </p><p>
	Here for example is the important part of the
	<code class="filename">tk02</code> demo, extracted from the file
	<code class="filename">xtk02.c</code>, which is effectively the extended
	WISH definition file for the <code class="filename">tk02</code> demo.
	Comments and other miscellany are omitted.

	The calls to <code class="literal">Tcl_Init()</code> and
	<code class="literal">Tk_Init()</code> are in every WISH.  To make an
	extended WISH, you add calls to the initialization routines for any
	extension packages you want to use, in this [incr Tcl]
	(<code class="literal">Itcl_Init()</code>) and PLplot
	(<code class="literal">Pltk_Init()</code>).  Finally you add keywords to the
	interpreter, associating them with functions in your code using
	<code class="literal">Tcl_CreateCommand()</code> as shown.
      </p><p>
	In particular, PLplot has a number of [incr Tcl] classes in its Tcl
	library.  If you want to be able to use those in your WISH, you
	need to include the initialization of [incr Tcl].
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="wish-linking"></a>WISH Linking</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Having constructed your <code class="literal">Tcl_AppInit()</code> function,
	you now merely need to link this file with your own private files
	to provide the code for any functions you registered via
	<code class="literal">Tcl_CreateCommand()</code> (and any they depend on),
	against the Tcl, Tk and extension libraries you are using.
      </p><p>
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  cc -c tkAppInit.c
	  cc -c mycommands.c
	  cc -o my_wish tkAppInit.o mycommands.o
	  -lplplotftk -ltcl -ltk -litcl -lX11 -lm</pre><p>
      </p><p>
	Add any needed <code class="literal">-L</code> options as needed.
      </p><p>
	Voila!  You have made a wish.

	Now you are ready to put the genie to work.  The basic plan here is
	to write shell scripts which use your new application specific
	windowing shell as their interpreter, to implement X Windows user
	interfaces to control and utilize the facilities made available in
	your extensions.
      </p><p>
	Effectively this just comes down to writing Tcl/Tk code, embellished
	as appropriate with calls to the extension commands you registered.
	Additionally, since this wish includes the PLplot extensions, you
	can instantiate any of the PLplot family of [incr Tcl] classes, and
	invoke methods on those objects to effect the drawing of graphs.
	Similarly, you may have your extension commands (which are coded in
	C) call the PLplot C programmers API to draw into the widget.  In
	this way you can have the best of both worlds.  Use compiled C code
	when the computational demands require the speed of compiled code,
	or use Tcl when your programming convenience is more important than
	raw speed.
