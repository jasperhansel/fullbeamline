<chapter id="API-Internal">
  <title>Internal C functions in PLplot</title>

  <para>
    The purpose of this chapter is to document the API for every internal
    C function in PLplot (other than language bindings) that
    is <emphasis>not</emphasis> part of the common API that has already been
    documented in <xref linkend="API"/> or elsewhere. The functions documented
    here are internal plplot functions. They are not intended for external use
    and may change between releases.
  </para>

  <para>
    This chapter is a work that is just starting.  There are many C functions
    in the code base that are not part of the common API, and we haven't even
    gotten to the point of listing them all.  What gets documented here now
    is whatever C-explicit code we are trying to understand at the time.

    <para> Checks to see if any of the specified drivers have been
    initialized. Function tests a space-delimited list of driver names to
    see how many of the given drivers have been initialized, and how often.
    The return code of the function is: <literal>0</literal> if no matching
    drivers were found to have been initialized; <literal>-1</literal> if
    an error occurred allocating the internal buffer; or, a positive number
    indicating the number of streams encountered that belong to drivers on
    the provided list. This function invokes &plP_getinitdriverlist;
    internally to get a <emphasis>complete</emphasis> list of drivers that have been initialized
    in order to compare with the driver names specified in the argument list
    to &plP_checkdriverinit;.

    <para> Get the initialized-driver list. Function returns a
    space-delimited list of the currently initialized drivers or streams. If more
    than one stream is using the same driver, then its name will be returned
    more than once. The function can be analogously thought of as also
    returning the names of the active streams.  Invoked internally by
    &plP_checkdriverinit;. </para>
