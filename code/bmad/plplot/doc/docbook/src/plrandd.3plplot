.SH NAME
\fBplrandd\fP - Random number generator returning a real random number in the range [0,1]
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplrandd\fP()
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Random number generator returning a real random number in the range [0,1]. The generator is based on the Mersenne Twister. Most languages / compilers provide their own random number generator, and so this is provided purely for convenience and to give a consistent random number generator across all languages supported by PLplot. This is particularly useful for comparing results from the test suite of examples.
