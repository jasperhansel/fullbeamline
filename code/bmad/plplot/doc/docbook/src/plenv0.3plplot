.SH NAME
\fBplenv0\fP - Same as \fBplenv\fP(3plplot) but if in multiplot mode does not advance the subpage, instead clears it
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplenv0\fP(\fIxmin\fP, \fIxmax\fP, \fIymin\fP, \fIymax\fP, \fIjust\fP, \fIaxis\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Sets up plotter environment for simple graphs by calling \fBpladv\fP(3plplot) and setting up viewport and window to sensible default values. \fBplenv0\fP(3plplot) leaves a standard margin (left-hand margin of eight character heights, and a margin around the other three sides of five character heights) around most graphs for axis labels and a title.  When these defaults are not suitable, use the individual routines \fBplvpas\fP(3plplot), \fBplvpor\fP(3plplot), or \fBplvasp\fP(3plplot) for setting up the viewport, \fBplwind\fP(3plplot) for defining the window, and \fBplbox\fP(3plplot) for drawing the box.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplenv0(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, just, axis)\fP
.P
This function is used in example 21.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIxmin\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Value of x at left-hand edge of window (in world coordinates).
.TP
\fIxmax\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Value of x at right-hand edge of window (in world coordinates).
.TP
\fIymin\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Value of y at bottom edge of window (in world coordinates).
.TP
\fIymax\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Value of y at top edge of window (in world coordinates).
.TP
\fIjust\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Controls how the axes will be scaled: -1: the scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale before calling \fBplenv0\fP(3plplot) using \fBplsvpa\fP(3plplot), \fBplvasp\fP(3plplot) or other.
0: the x and y axes are scaled independently to use as much of the screen as possible.
1: the scales of the x and y axes are made equal.
2: the axis of the x and y axes are made equal, and the plot box will be square.

.TP
\fIaxis\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Controls drawing of the box around the plot: -2: draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick labels, no axes.
-1: draw box only.
0: draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.
1: also draw coordinate axes at x=0 and y=0.
2: also draw a grid at major tick positions in both coordinates.
3: also draw a grid at minor tick positions in both coordinates.
10: same as 0 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
11: same as 1 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
12: same as 2 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
13: same as 3 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
20: same as 0 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
21: same as 1 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
22: same as 2 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
23: same as 3 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
30: same as 0 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
31: same as 1 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
32: same as 2 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
33: same as 3 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
40: same as 0 except date / time x labels.
41: same as 1 except date / time x labels.
42: same as 2 except date / time x labels.
43: same as 3 except date / time x labels.
50: same as 0 except date / time y labels.
51: same as 1 except date / time y labels.
52: same as 2 except date / time y labels.
53: same as 3 except date / time y labels.
60: same as 0 except date / time x and y labels.
61: same as 1 except date / time x and y labels.
62: same as 2 except date / time x and y labels.
63: same as 3 except date / time x and y labels.
70: same as 0 except custom x and y labels.
71: same as 1 except custom x and y labels.
72: same as 2 except custom x and y labels.
73: same as 3 except custom x and y labels.
