.SH NAME
\fBplclear\fP - Clear current (sub)page
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplclear\fP()
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Clears the current page, effectively erasing everything that have been drawn.  This command only works with interactive drivers; if the driver does not support this, the page is filled with the background color in use. If the current page is divided into subpages, only the current subpage is erased.  The nth subpage can be selected with \fBpladv\fP(3plplot)(n).
