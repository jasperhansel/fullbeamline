  <title>Embedding Plots in Graphical User Interfaces</title>

  <para>
    This chapter should describe how to embed plots in graphical user
    interfaces.  <xref linkend="extended-wish" /> does that for Tk, but
    embedding plots in GTK+ and Qt GUI's NEEDS DOCUMENTATION.  Until
    that GTK+ and QT4 documentation is prepared, look at
    examples/c/README.cairo and examples/c++/README.qt_example for
    some proof-of-concept examples.
