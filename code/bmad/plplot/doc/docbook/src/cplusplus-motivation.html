      PLplot has a fairly complex C API.  There are lots of functions, and
      several facilities have multiple entry points with similar names but
      different argument lists.  (Think contouring, shading).  Often these
      differing argument lists are to accommodate a variety of data storage
      paradigms, one of which you are expected to be using!
    </p><p>
      Especially in the case of the 2-d API's for contouring and shading,
      sophisticated C++ users may feel a special sense of exasperation with
      the data layout prescriptions, since they are extremely primitive,
      pointer rich, and prone to a wide class of memory leaks and other
      sorts of programming errors.  Many C++ users know good and well that
      better ways exist (templated matrix classes, etc), but historically
      have not been able to use these more sophisticated techniques if the
      contained data ever needed to get plotted.
    </p><p>
      Besides the 2-d API functions, there is also the multiple output
      stream capability of PLplot.  Anyone who knows C++ well, and who has
      used multiple output streams in PLplot, has probably noticed striking
      similarities between the PLplot <code class="literal">PLStream</code> pointer and the C++
      <code class="literal">this</code> pointer.  Although multiple output streams have not been
      widely used in PLplot applications in the past, the availability of
      the plframe Tk widget, and the extended wish concept, is making it
      much more attractive to use multiple output streams.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, if you do write a Tk extended wish application, and
      endow your interface with multiple plframes, the event driven
      character of X applications makes it difficult to ensure that PLplot
      output shows up in the right plframe window.  If a plot is generated
      to one plframe, the PLplot <code class="literal">PLStream</code> pointer is directed to that
      stream.  If a user then pushes a Tk button which should generate a
      plot to a different plframe, the plot goes to the old plframe instead!
      Schemes for controlling this can be imagined, but the logic can be
      complex, especially in the face of the ability to /also/ make plots to
      the same plframe from either Tcl or C++.
    </p><p>
      Beyond this, the C API is downright "ugly" for a significant number of
      the functions, particularly those which return values by accepting
      pointers to variables in their argument lists, and then changing them
      in that way.  Sophisticated C++ users generally take considerable
      pride in banishing the offensive bare pointer from their code, and
      consider it disgusting to have to insert &amp;'s just in order to make a
      call to an API function.
    </p><p>
      In order to address these issues (and more), I have begun constructing
      a C++ interface to PLplot.  The purpose of this missive is to describe
      its architecture and usage.
