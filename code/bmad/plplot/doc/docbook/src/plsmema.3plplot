\fBplsmema\fP(\fImaxx\fP, \fImaxy\fP, \fIplotmem\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set the memory area to be plotted (with the memcairo driver) as the dev member of the stream structure. Also set the number of pixels in the memory passed in \fIplotmem\fP, which is a block of memory \fImaxy\fP by \fImaxx\fP by 4 bytes long, say: 480 x 640 x 4 (Y, X, RGBA)
.P
This memory will have to be freed by the user!
