.SH NAME
\fBplsesc\fP - Set the escape character for text strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsesc\fP(\fIesc\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set the escape character for text strings.  From C (in contrast to Fortran 95, see \fBplsescfortran95\fP(3plplot)) you pass \fIesc\fP as a character. Only selected characters are allowed to prevent the user from shooting himself in the foot (For example, a \ isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's use of backslash as a character escape).  Here are the allowed escape characters and their corresponding decimal ASCII values: !, ASCII 33
#, ASCII 35
$, ASCII 36
%, ASCII 37
&, ASCII 38
*, ASCII 42
@, ASCII 64
^, ASCII 94
~, ASCII 126
