      Device-driver libraries are libraries which are built as part to the
      PLplot build and which are linked by PLplot device drivers.  At this
      time we only have one example of this, the NIST cd library which makes
      it easy to create files in CGM format.  The original name of this
      library was libcd, but we call it libnistcd to distinguish it from all
      other "cd" libraries out there.  This library is linked by our cgm
      device driver.

      CGM format is a long-established (since 1987) open standard for vector
      graphics (see http://www.w3.org/Graphics/WebCGM/).  The libnistcd
      software was developed by G. Edward Johnson at NIST to provide
      convenient access to the CGM format.  The library is no longer
      maintained (the last official release was in 1997), but the software
      is mature and works well.  Furthermore, it is in the public domain
      except for the small part licensed under the libgd open-source license
      (see lib/nistcd/cd.html in the PLplot source tree).  PLplot developers
      have added a modern CMake-based build system for libnistcd and also
      have done some visibility support so the code builds properly
      under Windows and also under Linux with gcc when the
      -fvisibility=hidden option for gcc is used.  Otherwise, the code is
      identical to the 1997 version.  For documentation of the libnistcd API
      see lib/nistcd/cd.html in the PLplot source tree.
