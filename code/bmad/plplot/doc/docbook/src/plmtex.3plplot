.SH NAME
\fBplmtex\fP - Write text relative to viewport boundaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplmtex\fP(\fIside\fP, \fIdisp\fP, \fIpos\fP, \fIjust\fP, \fItext\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Writes text at a specified position relative to the viewport boundaries.  Text may be written inside or outside the viewport, but is clipped at the subpage boundaries.  The reference point of a string lies along a line passing through the string at half the height of a capital letter.  The position of the reference point along this line is determined by \fIjust\fP, and the position of the reference point relative to the viewport is set by \fIdisp\fP and \fIpos\fP.
.P
Redacted form: General: \fBplmtex(side, disp, pos, just, text)\fP
Perl/PDL: \fBplmtex(disp, pos, just, side, text)\fP

.P
This function is used in examples 3, 4, 6-8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 23, and 26.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIside\fP (\fBPLCHAR_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
An ascii character string specifying the side of the viewport along which the text is to be written. The string must be one of: b: Bottom of viewport, text written parallel to edge.
bv: Bottom of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.
l: Left of viewport, text written parallel to edge.
lv: Left of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.
r: Right of viewport, text written parallel to edge.
rv: Right of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.
t: Top of viewport, text written parallel to edge.
tv: Top of viewport, text written at right angles to edge.

.TP
\fIdisp\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Position of the reference point of string, measured outwards from the specified viewport edge in units of the current character height.  Use negative \fIdisp\fP to write within the viewport.
.TP
\fIpos\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Position of the reference point of string along the specified edge, expressed as a fraction of the length of the edge.
.TP
\fIjust\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Specifies the position of the string relative to its reference point.  If \fIjust\fP=0. , the reference point is at the left and if \fIjust\fP=1. , it is at the right of the string.  Other values of \fIjust\fP give intermediate justifications.
.TP
\fItext\fP (\fBPLCHAR_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A UTF-8 character string to be written out.
