.SH NAME
\fBplot3dc\fP - Magnitude colored plot surface with contour
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplot3dc\fP(\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIz\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP, \fIopt\fP, \fIclevel\fP, \fInlevel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Aside from dropping the \fIside\fP functionality this is a more powerful form of \fB\fBplot3d\fP(3plplot)\fP: the surface mesh can be colored accordingly to the current z value being plotted, a contour plot can be drawn at the base XY plane, and a curtain can be drawn between the plotted function border and the base XY plane. The arguments are identical to those of \fB\fBplmeshc\fP(3plplot)\fP. The only difference between \fBplmeshc\fP(3plplot) and \fBplot3dc\fP(3plplot) is that \fBplmeshc\fP(3plplot) draws the bottom side of the surface, while \fBplot3dc\fP(3plplot) only draws the surface as viewed from the top.
.P
Redacted form: General: \fBplot3dc(x, y, z, opt, clevel)\fP
Perl/PDL: Not available?

.P
This function is used in example 21.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIx\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the x coordinates at which the function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIy\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the y coordinates at which the function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIz\fP (\fBPLFLT_MATRIX\fP(3plplot), input)
A matrix containing function values to plot.  Should have dimensions of \fInx\fP by \fIny\fP.
.TP
\fInx\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of \fIx\fP values at which function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIny\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of \fIy\fP values at which function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIopt\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Determines the way in which the surface is represented. To specify more than one option just add the options, e.g. DRAW_LINEXY + MAG_COLOR \fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEX : Lines are drawn showing \fIz\fP as a function of \fIx\fP for each value of \fIy\fP[j] .
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEY : Lines are drawn showing \fIz\fP as a function of \fIy\fP for each value of \fIx\fP[i] .
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_LINEXY : Network of lines is drawn connecting points at which function is defined.
\fIopt\fP=MAG_COLOR : Each line in the mesh is colored according to the z value being plotted. The color is used from the current cmap1.
\fIopt\fP=BASE_CONT : A contour plot is drawn at the base XY plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP.
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_SIDES : draws a curtain between the base XY plane and the borders of the plotted function.

.TP
\fIclevel\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the contour levels.
.TP
\fInlevel\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of elements in the clevel vector.
