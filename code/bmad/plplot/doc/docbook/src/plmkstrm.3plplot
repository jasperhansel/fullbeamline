.SH NAME
\fBplmkstrm\fP - Creates a new stream and makes it the default
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplmkstrm\fP(\fIp_strm\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Creates a new stream and makes it the default.  Differs from using \fBplsstrm\fP(3plplot), in that a free stream number is found, and returned. Unfortunately, I have to start at stream 1 and work upward, since stream 0 is preallocated.  One of the big flaws in the PLplot API is that no initial, library-opening call is required.  So stream 0 must be preallocated, and there is no simple way of determining whether it is already in use or not.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplmkstrm(p_strm)\fP
.P
This function is used in examples 1 and 20.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIp_strm\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of the stream number of the created stream.
