      a slightly subtle point regarding the use and declaration of vectors and
      matrices. The package <code class="literal">PLplot_Auxiliary</code> declares the
      types</p><pre class="programlisting">
    type Real_Vector is array (Integer range &lt;&gt;) of Long_Float;
    type Real_Matrix is array (Integer range &lt;&gt;, Integer range &lt;&gt;) of Long_Float;
</pre><p>These declarations mimic exactly the declarations described in
      Annex G.3, Vector and Matrix Manipulation, of the Ada 2005 reference
      manual when the generic package therein described is specialized for
      <code class="literal">Long_Float</code>. The reason for this approach is to avoid
      requiring the user program to <code class="literal">with</code>
      <code class="literal">Ada.Numerics.Long_Real_Arrays</code> simply to gain access
      to these types and in the process require linking to the BLAS and LAPACK
      numerical libraries.</p><p>Ada 2005 introduced an annex G.3 which formally defines vector and
      matrix support to Ada, along with some common mathematical operations on
      those types. (This feature is a specific to vectors and matrices and
      extends the usual array apparatus.) The Ada PLplot user has a choice on how
      to deal with this. The default, as described in
      <code class="literal">PLplot_Auxiliary.ads</code>,
      has <code class="literal">Real_Vector</code> and <code class="literal">Real_Matrix</code>
      declared therein, separate from the Ada 2005 declarations. This allows the
      widest compatibility and does not require an Ada 2005 compiler. However,
      many users will want to gain the benefit of the built-in declarations of
      Ada 2005. This is easily done: Read the short comments in
      <code class="literal">PLplot_Auxiliary.ads</code> on how to comment-out two lines and
      uncomment three lines. Either configuration will compile correctly, but
      depending on the Cmake configuration to expose an Ada 2005 compiler in the later
      case. (Note that at some points in the documentation, Ada 2005 is referred
      to as Ada 2007, including some Cmake flags.)</p><p>This policy was changed in SVN version 11153. Before this, the
      type of compiler (Ada 95 or Ada 2005) had to be specified at the time
      that PLplot was built, and in the case of Ada 2005, the BLAS and LAPACK
      libraries had to be present and were subsequently linked.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_gnat_nongnat"></a>GNAT versus non-GNAT</h3></div></div></div><p>The bindings were made using the GNAT compiler and there is a
      slight dependence on that compiler. Specifically, the
      <code class="literal">Unrestricted_Access</code> attribute of GNAT was used in
      making the function <code class="literal">Matrix_To_Pointers</code> in
      <code class="literal">plplotthin.adb</code> and in a few callbacks.
      <code class="literal">Matrix_To_Pointers</code> is called whenever an Ada matrix
      (2D array) is passed to a PLplot subroutine. For more about
      <code class="literal">Unrestricted_Access attribute</code>, see Implementation
      Defined Attributes in the GNAT Reference Manual. This dependency
      shouldn't be difficult to remove by either incorporating the GNAT code
      which implements it, by following the TO-DO comment near the function
      definition in <code class="literal">plplotthin.adb</code>, or by providing the
      proper aliasing.</p><p>Another GNAT dependency is used to parse command line arguments in
      a C-like way.</p><p>Pragma Warnings (Off, "some text") and Pragma Warnings (On, "some
      text") are used in the bindings to suppress warnings about a particular
      method used to interface with C code. These pragmas are also used in
      Ada Examples 21 to suppress a particular warning. Pragma Warnings is a
      GNAT extension. Non-GNAT usage could simply remove these pragmas with
      the resulting warnings ignored as they are benign.</p><p>Most of the GNAT dependencies can be found by searching the source
      code for "<code class="literal">GNAT</code>",
      "<code class="literal">Unrestricted_Access</code> and <code class="literal">Pragma Warnings</code>."</p><p>The GNAT dependence, though slight, will no doubt frustrate users
      of other Ada compilers. We welcome comments from those users, especially
      comments with specific suggestions on how to remove any GNAT-specific
      usages.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ada_sample_project"></a>Sample command line project</h3></div></div></div><p>It is instructive to present a simple example that can be compiled
      and run from the command line. Although this example is specific to one
      installation, it should be fairly straightforward to adapt it to another
      installation. Toward that end, it is helpful to understand the PLplot
      lingo of "build directory" and "installation directory."</p><p>Here is a simple program that will generate a plot of part of a
      parabola.</p><pre class="programlisting">
 with
    PLplot_Auxiliary,
    PLplot;
 use
    PLplot_Auxiliary,
    PLplot;
 procedure Simple_Example is
    x, y : Real_Vector(-10 .. 10);
 begin
    for i in x'range loop
       x(i) := Long_Float(i);
       y(i) := x(i)**2;
    end loop;
    Initialize_PLplot; -- Call this only once.
    Simple_Plot(x, y); -- Make the plot.
    End_PLplot;        -- Call this only once.
 end Simple_Example;
      </pre><p>Next is a bash script that will compile, bind, and link it. It is
      installation-specific in that paths to the GNAT compiler, PLplot
      libraries, and BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System) and LAPACK (Linear
      Algebra Package) are hard-coded. You will have to adjust the paths to
      fit your installation. Some Linux installations which have GNAT 4.3 or
      later (Ada 2005) preinstalled might have already set the paths to the
      BLAS and LAPACK libraries.</p><p>(Note that the G.3 Annex of Ada 2005, in the GNAT version, depends
      heavily on BLAS and LAPACK. These packages are tried-and-true packages
      that are available from several places in either C or Fortran versions.
      The present example is specific to OS X which has both C and Fortran
      versions preinstalled.)</p><pre class="programlisting">
