.SH NAME
\fBplbtime\fP - Calculate broken-down time from continuous time for the current stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplbtime\fP(\fIyear\fP, \fImonth\fP, \fIday\fP, \fIhour\fP, \fImin\fP, \fIsec\fP, \fIctime\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Calculate broken-down time; \fIyear\fP, \fImonth\fP, \fIday\fP, \fIhour\fP, \fImin\fP, \fIsec\fP; from continuous time, \fIctime\fP for the current stream.  This function is the inverse of \fBplctime\fP(3plplot).
.P
The PLplot definition of broken-down time is a calendar time that completely ignores all time zone offsets, i.e., it is the user's responsibility to apply those offsets (if so desired) before using the PLplot time API.  By default broken-down time is defined using the proleptic Gregorian calendar without the insertion of leap seconds and continuous time is defined as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. However, other definitions of broken-down and continuous time are possible, see \fBplconfigtime\fP(3plplot).
.P
Redacted form: General: \fBplbtime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec, ctime)\fP

.P
This function is used in example 29.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIyear\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of years with positive values corresponding to CE (i.e., 1 = 1 CE, etc.) and non-negative values corresponding to BCE (e.g., 0 = 1 BCE, -1 = 2 BCE, etc.)
.TP
\fImonth\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of month within the year in the range from 0 (January) to 11 (December).
.TP
\fIday\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of day within the month in the range from 1 to 31.
.TP
\fIhour\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of hour within the day in the range from 0 to 23.
.TP
\fImin\fP (\fBPLINT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of minute within the hour in the range from 0 to 59
.TP
\fIsec\fP (\fBPLFLT_NC_SCALAR\fP(3plplot), output)
Returned value of second within the minute in range from 0. to 60.
.TP
\fIctime\fP (\fBPLFLT\fP(3plplot), input)
Continous time from which the broken-down time is calculated.
