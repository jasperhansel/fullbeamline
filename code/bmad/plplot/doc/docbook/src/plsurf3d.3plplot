.SH NAME
\fBplsurf3d\fP - Plot shaded 3-d surface plot
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsurf3d\fP(\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIz\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP, \fIopt\fP, \fIclevel\fP, \fInlevel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Plots a three-dimensional shaded surface plot within the environment set up by \fBplw3d\fP(3plplot).  The surface is defined by the two-dimensional matrix \fIz\fP[\fInx\fP][\fIny\fP], the point \fIz\fP[i][j] being the value of the function at (\fIx\fP[i],\fIy\fP[j]). Note that the points in vectors \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP do not need to be equally spaced, but must be stored in ascending order. For further details see the PLplot documentation.
.P
Redacted form: \fBplsurf3d(x, y, z, opt, clevel)\fP
.P
This function is not used in any examples.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIx\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the x coordinates at which the function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIy\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the y coordinates at which the function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIz\fP (\fBPLFLT_MATRIX\fP(3plplot), input)
A matrix containing function values to plot.  Should have dimensions of \fInx\fP by \fIny\fP.
.TP
\fInx\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of \fIx\fP values at which function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIny\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of \fIy\fP values at which function is evaluated.
.TP
\fIopt\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Determines the way in which the surface is represented. To specify more than one option just add the options, e.g. FACETED + SURF_CONT \fIopt\fP=FACETED : Network of lines is drawn connecting points at which function is defined.
\fIopt\fP=BASE_CONT : A contour plot is drawn at the base XY plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP.
\fIopt\fP=SURF_CONT : A contour plot is drawn at the surface plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP.
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_SIDES : draws a curtain between the base XY plane and the borders of the plotted function.
\fIopt\fP=MAG_COLOR : the surface is colored according to the value of Z; if MAG_COLOR is not used, then the surface is colored according to the intensity of the reflected light in the surface from a light source whose position is set using \fBpllightsource\fP(3plplot).

.TP
\fIclevel\fP (\fBPLFLT_VECTOR\fP(3plplot), input)
A vector containing the contour levels.
.TP
\fInlevel\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of elements in the clevel vector.
