      The enhancement libraries add essential functionality to the PLplot core
      library (see <a class="xref" href="core-library.html" title="The PLplot Core Library">the section called “The PLplot Core Library”</a>).  They consist of a
      cubic spline approximation library, libcsirocsa; a natural neighbours
      interpolation library, libcsironn; and a time format conversion library
      libqsastime.

	This library grew out of a discussion with Steve Schwartz of the QSAS
	Support Team, Cluster Science Centre, Imperial College and our mutual
	frustrations with the poor time conversion capabilities of
	POSIX-compliant computer operating systems.  For such systems, the
	continuous time variable is often stored internally as a 32-bit
	integer containing the number of seconds since 1970.  This gives a
	limited date range of only 136 years, and a limited numerical
	precision of only a second.  Furthermore, although the POSIX standard
	includes gmtime which provides a conversion between broken-down time
	(year, month, day, hour, min, sec), and the continuous time variable,
	the inverse of gmtime (called timegm on Linux) is not a POSIX
	standard.  Finally, the POSIX standard ignores leap seconds.  All
	these limitations are not acceptable for plotting of scientific time
	series and are addressed by the qsastime library which was originally
	donated under the LGPL to the PLplot project in early 2009 by Anthony
	J. Allen of the QSAS team and substantially modified after that by a
	PLplot developer, Alan W. Irwin (e.g., to add leap-second
	functionality).
      </p><p>
	The qsastime library uses MJD (modified Julian Date = Julian Date -
	2400000.5) for the internal continuous time variable.  This variable
	is stored as a signed int (to hold the integer part) and a double (to
	hold the seconds since midnight).  On 32-bit systems, this combination
	gives an effective date range of roughly +/- 6 million years
	from the MJD epoch in late 1858 and an effective numerical time
	precision of 0.01 ns.  This should cover most range and precision
	requirements of those doing plots of scientific time series.
      </p><p>
	The qsastime library provides internal routines to convert between the
	broken-down time representation and the internal continuous time
	variable and vice versa using the formal rules of either the Gregorian
	or Julian calendars.  These routines have been tested extensively for
	the internal consistency of the routines both for the Gregorian and
	Julian calendars and also by comparing the Gregorian results against the
	equivalent Linux C library gmtime and timegm routines on a 64-bit
	platform.  These tests were done for a number of epochs including every
	year from -5000000 to 5000000 for critical dates in the year (January
	1, February 28, February 29, March 1, and December 31).  These extensive
	tests give some confidence that the formal conversion from broken-down
	to continuous time (and vice versa) should be reliable for the
	qsastime library on all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
      </p><p>
	The qsastime library also provides an internal routine that gives
	formatted time results as a function of continuous time.  This routine
	has been lightly tested against the results of the C library strftime
	routine on Linux.
      </p><p>
	The three internal routines described above are wrapped by functions
	that provide the externally visible API for the qsastime library.
	This API is described below.
