.SH NAME
\fBplcpstrm\fP - Copy state parameters from the reference stream to the current stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplcpstrm\fP(\fIiplsr\fP, \fIflags\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Copies state parameters from the reference stream to the current stream. Tell driver interface to map device coordinates unless \fIflags\fP == 1.
.P
This function is used for making save files of selected plots (e.g. from the TK driver).  After initializing, you can get a copy of the current plot to the specified device by switching to this stream and issuing a \fBplcpstrm\fP(3plplot) and a \fBplreplot\fP(3plplot), with calls to \fBplbop\fP(3plplot) and \fBpleop\fP(3plplot) as appropriate.  The plot buffer must have previously been enabled (done automatically by some display drivers, such as X).
.P
Redacted form: \fBplcpstrm(iplsr, flags)\fP
.P
This function is used in example 1,20.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIiplsr\fP (\fBPLINT\fP(3plplot), input)
Number of reference stream.
.TP
\fIflags\fP (\fBPLBOOL\fP(3plplot), input)
If \fIflags\fP is set to true the device coordinates are not copied from the reference to current stream.
