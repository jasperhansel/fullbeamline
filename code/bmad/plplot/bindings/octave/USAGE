You must add the plplot_octave script installation directory to Octave
path *before* the standard Octave path if you want to use plplot
graphics by default. The best way to do this is to create a .octaverc
file in your home directory.

With octave 2.1 or earlier you can use LOADPATH, e.g.

LOADPATH = [ ":<install-directory>/share/plplot_octave//", LOADPATH ]

With octave 2.9 and later, LOADPATH has been deprecated and you need to
use addpath instead. You also need to explicitly add in any
subdirectories you wish to search, e.g.

addpath("<install-directory>/share/plplot_octave", ...
        "<install-directory>/share/plplot_octave/support")

If you also want to use Octave's standard plotting package, gnuplot, you
can use the command "toggle_plplot_use" to switch between the two plot
packages. Read the INSTALL file for more details.

Then, invoke Octave and create a vector, say

	octave:1> x=-pi:0.1:pi;

and plot it

	plot(x,sin(x))

change the legend:

	plot(x,sin(x),';Sin(x);')

set the title and plot data points
	
	title "My first plot";
	plot(x,sin(x),'-o;Sin(x);')

change the legend position

	legend ("opaque",0.8,0.5);
	plot(x,sin(x),';Sin(x);');

save you plot in color postscript

	save_fig ("~/sin.ps","psc")

and see the result
	
	system("gv ~/sin.ps")

create a new plot window using the tk driver

	fig(1,"tk")

Use uper an subscript in captions

	title("Sin(x#u2#d)")
	plot(x,sin(x),'-o;Sin(x#u2#d);',x,cos(x),'y');

close the previous window

	closefig(0)

read the online help

	help plot
	help __pl_opt

and try it! Bellow is a short description of the available commands.
You also have access to the PLplot API,

	help plfill

		plfill(x, y)

		   Original PLplot call documentation:

		   plfill(n, x, y) ...

NOTES: - You don't need to specify vector or matrix dimensions.
       - When setting the plplot variable "pl_automatic_replot = 1",
         changes take effect immediately, otherwise they only take
         effect at the next plot.
