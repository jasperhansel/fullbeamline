## function plsetopt(option, value)
##
## set "option" to "value". Must be called before openning a plot window.
## No check in "value" is done, and some options might be senseless,
## depending on the driver.
##
## If "reset" is specified as an option, all stored options are cleared.
## If "show" is specified as an option, all stored options are printed.
## If "help" is specified as an option, all options and help are printed.
## If "apply" is specified as an option, all set options are applied.
## If "get" is specified as an option, the current option value is returned
