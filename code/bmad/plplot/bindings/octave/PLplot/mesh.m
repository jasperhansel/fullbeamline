## usage: mesh ([x, y,] z)
##
## Surface plot.  If x, y, and z are matrices with the same dimensions,
## then corresponding elements represent vertices of the plot.  If x and
## y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (x(j), y(i), z(i,j)).  Thus,
## columns of z correspond to different x values and rows of z correspond
## to different y values.
