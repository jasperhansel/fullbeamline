## usage: surfl ([x, y,] z [, s])
##
## Shaded Surface plot with lighting.
##
## If x, y, and z are matrices with the same dimensions,
##    then corresponding elements represent vertices of the plot.
##
## If x and y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (x(j), y(i), z(i,j)).  Thus,
##    columns of z correspond to different x values and rows of z correspond
##    to different y values.
##
## `s', if existent, set the light source in cartesian coordinates [Sx Sy Sz]
##    or [Saz Sel] in spherical coordinates; in this case, the light source will
##    be at a distance 10 from the origin.
##    Ilumination can also be set by pllightsource(Sx, Sy, Sz)
