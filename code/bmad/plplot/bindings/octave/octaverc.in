# examples.  Those automated tests are configured similarly to this
# file (but differently for the build tree and install tree) and use
# the octave -f option to be independent of any octave setup file such
# as this one.

# Disable warnings about shadowed functions - PLplot is _supposed_ to shadow the core functions
