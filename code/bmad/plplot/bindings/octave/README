This package enables you to use PLplot from within Octave.

You have several advantages over Octave default plotter:

	Use a superior plotting package, having access to dozens
	of plotting commands, enabling you to customize your plots
	at your will,

	Still use the same plot commands that you are familiarized,
	if you really want to,

	Have some new and long waited plotting command scripts.

If you build the Tcl/Tk driver, optional, you have a menu driven
way to plot to a file, choose the output device, zoom, pan, change
colors, etc.

Besides having access to all PLplot API commands, and all Octave usual
commands, some with some improvements, new plot commands are available.

Read the INSTALL file to continue.
