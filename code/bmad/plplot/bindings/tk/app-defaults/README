Application-defaults files (to set X resources) for use with PLplot & Tk.

To use:

1. Create a directory for holding app-defaults files.  $HOME/app-defaults/
   is a good choice.  Then set the XAPPLRESDIR environmental to this
   pathname (keep trailing slash).

2. Copy an appropriate PLplot.*.ap file to the file PLplot under $XAPPLRESDIR.
   Then modify to taste.  Note -- future versions of PLplot are likely to
   break compatibility with the old app-defaults files periodically.

These files use the standard X11 resource syntax.

Suggested uses:
 - on a 1024x768 display (such as on a portable computer), use the small
   settings.
 - on a 1280x1024 workstation for most people, use the medium settings.
 - for the latter, use the large settings for something very easy to see.
   (PLplot classic settings)

Feel free to add more customized versions.
