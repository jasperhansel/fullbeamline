The latest release of Genesis supports parallel computer architecture,
based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. To avoid the maintance
of two codes the genesis source code supports both, but the user has to do
some minor modification before compiling.

The distribution includes a sample Makefile which can be used to compile the code
on any platform. The Makefile uses the GNU Fortran compiler as well as the
MPICH compiler for mpi codes, but which is based on the GNU Fortran compiler as well.
If a different compiler is used the compile instructions might be different, in particular
the compiler and linker flags.

----------------------------------

Compiling as a single processor code:

1) Make a copy of 'mpi.f.single' in the same directory and name it 'mpi.f'
It mostly contains some empty wrapper function to mimick the call of MPI
functions.

2) Make a copy of 'mpif.h.single' in the same directory and name it 'mpif.h'.
It contains some parameter definition which are not of importance for the single 
processor version, but nevertheless required to use the same source code.

3) Compile the source code

-----------------------------------

Compiling as a multi processor code:

1) Make a copy of 'mpi.f.multi' in the same directory and name it 'mpi.f'.
It contains all the routines to manage the parallel environment.

2) Make sure that there is no file named 'mpif.h' in the directory. MPI compilers
will supply their own version of this file, which is necessary to compile any MPI program.

3) Compile the source code
